      Following the normal W3C conventions, there were two different
      kind of releases of <b>Jigsaw</b>. Member release are provided
      to W3C members, a month in advance of the Public
      Release. Depending on their status the member release may get a
      different release number then the public release. On this page,
      you will find the release notes for the different versions of
      <b>Jigsaw</b> (which don't necessarily coincide with member
      release). From the beginning of 1998, the releases are only
      public ones, we still add the word "public" to avoid any
      confusion.</p>
    
    <p class="pintro"><span class="larger">NOTE!</span> The odd number in the
      middle state that this is NOT a stable release, not that it is unstable,
      but it means that not all the features are present, and that some more
      testing is needed until it gets its even middle number.</p>

      <h2><a name="2.2.6"></a>Jigsaw 2.2.6</h2>
      <b>A public release, made on April 10th, 2007.</b>

      <p>This version is a bugfix and optimized version of 2.2.5. It may be
         the latest using jdk1.2 only code.</p>


      <h3>New Features</h3>
       <p>
	Support for more XML Parsers in the Resources deserialization code
      </p>
      
      <ul>
	<li>Added support for connection reuse policies in the 
	  Client stack.</li>
	<li>Added a default policy to reuse the same connection when the 
	  thread matches (in HttpBasicConnection)</li>
	<li>Added a socket timeout on request
	  parsing, to avoid having it linked to request timeout</li>
	<li>The Servlet runner thread now use the server
	  timeout mechanism to interrupt the running thread when the server
	  is closing the request on timeout.</li>
	<li>Added a method to print Dates in ISO 8601 format without 
	  milliseconds</li>
	<li>Added a "detach" method to HttpBasicConnection to remove a 
	  connection from the list of used client connections but without 
	  closing the socket immediately (used when the client hits a 
	  HTTP/1.0 server that doesn't send Content-Length). </li>
	
      <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
      <ul>  
	<li>Fixed cookie parsing bug, if the cookie value contains a '='</li>
	<li>Fixed SAX parsing of stores and remote resource description (allow multiple 'characters' call for one value)</li>
	<li>Removed an unneeded synchronization point in HTTPFrame.getURL()</li>
	<li>Added an extra SP when exporting auth headers with different components</li>
	<li>Fixed source code to remove 'enum' as it is now a keywork starting with JDK 1.5</li>
	<li>Fixed client connection deletion in connection reuse, it was leading to a leak in the client hashtable (and to lots of connections in CLOSE_WAIT).</li>
	<li>Fixed bug in DateParser (wrong timezone offset) thanks to Menno Jonkers</li>
	<li>Optimized a bit Digest Auth (the RFC2069 one) and implemented Digest Auth with qop="auth" per RFC2617 (available with SecurityLevel set to 2), See DigestQopAuthPrincipal</li>
	<li>Fixed a few WebDAV properties that were using wrong formats</li>
	<li>HeaderFilter now sets the relevant headers even when the reply is sent via the exception mechanism.</li>
	<li>More SSL and servlet related patches from Thomas Kopp.</li>
	<li>ActiveStream patch, under some condition, the same data 
	  could be re-read a data chunk (thanks to Doug Borland)</li>
	<li>The servlet parameter decoding now uses the right charset.</li>
	<li>Fixed error when file timestamp was not modified but the file was actually modified.</li>
	<li>Fixed deadlock during store change notification when the sweeper is running (very rare)</li>
	<li>Fixed server client count when load is raising from LIGHT to DEAD</li>
	<li>Fixed Segment information unpickle, as the segment start and size were not properly parsed, leading to an infinite loop</li>
	<li>More SSL patches from Thomas Kopp, see <a href="http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/java/classes/org/w3c/jigsaw/https/SSLAdapter.java?rev=1.7&amp;content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup">changelog</a> for more details.</li>

	<li>Fixed connection count when MimeParser did not started and connection was new.</li>
	<li>Client stack now reuses the
	  connection timeout parameter.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2><a name="2.2.5"></a>Jigsaw 2.2.5</h2>
      <b>A public release, made on June 8th, 2005.</b>

      <p>This version is a bugfix and optimized version of 2.2.4.

	the use of jdk1.4). </p>

      <h3>New Features</h3>
       <p>
	New Digest Authentication code has been added. 
	It now conforms to 
	<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt">RFC2617</a>. 
	The old code was implementing only the 
	<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2069.txt">RFC2069</a> 
	version of the Digest Authentication.
      </p>

      <h2><a name="2.2.4"></a>Jigsaw 2.2.4</h2>
      <b>A public release, made on February 18th, 2004.</b>

      <p>This version is a bugfix and optimized version of 2.2.3.
	It contains an updated version of the SSL code (that may require 
	the use of jdk1.4). It contains a <strong>security fix</strong>, so
	you are encouraged to update as soon as possible.</p>

      <h3>New Features</h3>
       <p>The HTTP Client stack has been completely reworked to be 
	faster and to avoid keeping information on too many remote servers.
	The client stack now also has a timeout on connect.
      </p>

      <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>Fix in the client stack persistent connection handler. It now closes the socket and mark the connection free when a "Connection: close" header is in the reply.</li>
	<li>SSL patches from Thomas Kopp.</li>
	<li>URI components now generate an exception when a separator is found</li>
	<li>Memory usage optimization of the serialization of a resource.</li>
	<li>Read/write of stores is now more fault tolerant.</li>
	<li>Fixed the client stack use of connections, also the global server knowledge hastable is now trimmed the right way.</li>
	<li>Fixed StatisticsFrame to use less StringBuffers</li>
	<li>Added a configurable timeout on connect, for the HTTP client stack. <code>org.w3c.www.protocol.http.connections.connTimeout</code> (defaulting to 1000ms)</li>
	<li>Fixed ContainerResource check for
	  duplicate key, the "new key" algorithm is now more random
	  (ie it uses the
	  whole scale instead of the object serial mask), as it was leading to
	  infinite loops on huge sites.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2><a name="2.2.3"></a>Jigsaw 2.2.3</h2>

	It also includes Jigedit with WebDAV support, a package with
	a specific WebDAV configuration will follow, and a tutorial to do the
	<a href="Doc/User/webdav.html">WebDAV setup</a> is already online.
	It is also the first release <a href="mailto:carine@w3.org">Carine
	  Bournez</a> worked on.
      </p>
      
      <h3>New Features</h3>
      <ul>

	<li>WebDAV enabled JigEdit</li>
	<li>Implementation of <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> 
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_asis.html">mod_asis</a>.</li>

	  PUT method, using 
	  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jtidy">JTidy</a>.</li>
      </ul>      
      
      <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>Previously uncaught error (ie: non Protocol ones) during lookup
	  are now resoved by sending a 400 Bad
          Request </li>
	<li>Fixed the way exception filters are called in httpd. Side 
	  effect, ErrorFilter works again </li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in TE Filter that was compressiong twice the stream
	  (need to figure out why it was called
          twice though) </li>
	<li>Fixed semantic of ; in the URI, with the right info given 
	  during lookup</li>
	<li>SECURITY FIX: Fixed security bug regarding URI parsing</li>
	<li>Added a flag to remove the URI from default error pages as well
	  as the proxy module (SECURITY FIX: avoiding cross
          scripting attacks)</li>
	<li>Fixed ServletMapper to do redirect the right way (host parsing).
	  It was interacting with new jdk1.4
          ipv6 scan </li>
	<li>Merged patches from 
	  <a href="mailto:Thomas.Kopp@dialogika.de">Thomas Kopp</a>
	  concerning servlets:
	  servlet loading, behaviour of
          SingleThreadModel </li>
	<li>Reverted 1.3 API calls to 1.2, or used reflection to use 
	  jdk1.3 only methods in the push package</li>
	<li>Added a specific frame to handle MKCOL and other 
	  collection-related WebDAV methods in Jigedit</li>
	<li>Fixed WebDAV implementation, it now sends all the requested
	  properties in a PROPFIND, with the
          right statuds for the undefined ones.</li>
	<li>Modified AclFilter to take benefit of skipBody </li>
	<li>Added skipBody in Request, it allows a filter to skip an eventual
	  body in a better way than error
          recovery. </li>
	<li>Fixed bug when Content-Type was not set (it was set but the value
	  of the HttpMimeType was null,
          defeating the usual check) </li>

	<li>Fixed trailing / for negotiated resources, it was ignored, 
	  resulting in bad relative links </li>
	<li>Fixed If-None-Match in HTTPFrame, it now handles *</li>

	  exception during save, the general
          save will continue (it was not the case before)</li>
	<li>In CvsFileFrame, cvs update is performed also prior to a PUT.</li>
	<li>Added stronger synchronization for log rotation. </li>
	<li>Fixed indexer so that fake file resource can be created, as it 
	  may be dangerous for directories, it is still
          forbidden on those. </li>
	<li>Fixed deadlock in DirectoryListerFrame, a lock was not done
	  resulting in locks done in the wrong order
          in concurrent access </li>
	<li>Fix NewStoreEntry, hashtable of loaded ResourceReference is now
	  cleared when the store is
          unloaded. </li>
	<li>Fix in EditableSlider, now a textfield can resize the boundaries 
	  of the slider, a non-extensible mode is
          also available </li>
	<li>Fixed RedirectedFrame to add Content-Location after the internal
	  redirect, and Referer is kept.</li>
	<li>Fixed NegotiatedFrame to gather filters from the selected
	  resource, collected during the lookup,
          instead of the perform. However perform may select the resource if
	  the state is lost because of another filter.</li>
	<li>Fixed error replies for JigEdit on a 412</li>
	<li>Added synchronization fo class loading in servlet's class
	  loader</li>

	<li>more HttpRange can now be created: "-500","500-", by using -1 as 
	  the default value</li>
	<li>The request parser now skip the body if sent directly by the client
	  when an error occured.</li>

	<li>Directory listing now ends the URI of the containers with a "/", 
	  preventing an extra redirect</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>Limitations</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>The jdbmResourceStore has not yet been ported, a consequence is
	  the lack of CacheFilter in the proxy, but it will be replaced soon
	  by a completely new cache.</li>

      <h2>Jigsaw 2.0.3</h2>
      <b>A public release, made on July the 27th, 1999.</b>

      <p>This release is a bugfix version of the 2.0.2, while 2.1.0 will add

	<li>Fixed ResourceStoreManager initialization, when another root 
	  resource was set, it may end up in resource duplication and

	  deletion loops. WARNING! You may have to redo your configuration if 
	  you changed the root resource!</li>
	<li>Fixed servlet timeout unit</li>
	<li>SSI Frame and servlet interaction fixed (no more chunking in that
	  case)</li>
	<li>Logger and port can be changed while the server is running.</li>

      <ul>
	<li>Digest Authentication</li>
	<li>Http Extension Framework (HttpExtFrame)</li>
	<li>New JigAdmin. This one should be more intuitive than the other, but
	  still, you probably need to understand the design to take best out of
	  it.</li>
	<li>JSDK2.1 (Servlet API) support.</li>
	<li>Per servlet timeout is possible</li>
	<li>JNI port of LibUnix, thanks to Roland Mainz</li>
	<li>New logger ExtendedCommonLogger, doing log rotation and using ECLF
	  format</li>
	<li>*forbid* can be used as a Container index</li>
	<li>Log file resolver, to do DNS resolution offline</li>

	  avoid automatic conversion of jdk1.2</li>
	<li>When indexing a file with multiple extensions, frames attirbutes
	  are now aggregated. <b>It requires the use of the new default 
	    indexer</b> provided in the distribution, as the Content-Type
	  for modifiers (like .fr) is now
	  set to *none*</li>
	<li>VirtualHost now remove automatically the ":80" added by some
	  robots.</li>
	<li>Extension matching process now does "perfect" match, then case
	  insensitive match if desired.</li>

	<li>index resolution for containers now add Content-Location</li>
	<li>PUT on negotiated resources is handled using ETags</li>
	<li>Users can add environment variable in the CgiFrame 
	  configuration</li>

	<li>URLDecoder updated to use InputStream AND Readers</li>
	<li>ContentTypeIndexer can now use wildcards (well only *) in its mime
	  type definitions.</li>
	<li>ThreadCache behaviour near the limit is now the right one, also 
	  there is a feature to wait for all the thread of the cache.</li>
	<li>PassDirectory can now act as a normal DirectoryResource is the
	  pass-target is not set</li>
      </ul>

	<b>JigAdmin</b> are now stored in a zip, the old version of <b>JigAdmin</b>
	will not work with this new version, you then need to upgrade both the server

      <b>A public release, made on January the 31th, 1998.</b>

      <p>This is a bug fix release of the previous beta release. The purpose of the
	"beta track" is to improve the stability of Jigsaw. For further developments,
	see the 2.0 track.</p>

      <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>Fixed revalidation mechanism with a <tt>no-cache</tt> directive.</li>
	<li>The update of a cached resource in case of a revalidation is now
	  correct.</li>
	<li>The <tt>Max-Forwards</tt> header is now well handled.</li>
	<li>The <tt>PUT</tt> and <tt>POST</tt> methods are now working well on
	  HTTP/1.1 servers.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in the <tt>Via</tt> header of proxied resources.</li>
	<li>Fixed default adds of HTTP headers that were wrong.</li>
	<li>debug of the classloader for servlets</li>
	<li>Bug fix in the jdbm enumerator.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Enhancements</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>The indexers can now create "ghost" resources to allow more fancy uses
	  of Jigsaw, like shadow icon directories.</li>
	<li>Added the <tt>TRACE</tt> method of HTTP/1.1</li>
	<li>Added the possibility of templates in the indexers</li>
	<li>the GrepPutFilter forbid a PUT of a document containing a specified
	  string. Very useful when you edit your website from one server and you
	  doesn'y want to allow links to this server.</li>
	<li>Added a DateThread, if you want to speed up Jigsaw a bit (~10% by
	  switching loggers).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2><a name="1.0beta"></a>Jigsaw 1.0beta</h2>
      <b>A member specific release, made on August the 1st, 1997.</b>

      <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>FileResource now supports the HTTP/1.1 <tt>If-Range</tt> header, and a
	  slight bug was fixed in the emitted <tt>Content-Range </tt>header</li>
	<li>The HTTP client side cache filter has been fixed (jdbmResourceStore
	  enumration was buggy)</li>
	<li>The Caught Exception trace in errlog has been removed (<i>The trace was
	    the bug</i> - tm)</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in ICP message parsing (will now correctly handle message of
	  length exceeding 255 bytes)</li>
	<li>If it manages a shared cache, the CacheFilter will no longer cache
	  documents retreive through a request that has an Authorization
	  header.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in HTTP Date parsing (one of the three date format wasn't
	  parsed properly)</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in ContentLengthInputStream (wrong size after an error on a
	  read)</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug in ActiveStream which was the source of empty documents
	  feeded by the proxy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Enhancements</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>Added a property in the <a
	    href="User/Reference/w3c.www.protocol.http.icp.ICPFilter.html#w3c.www.protocol.http.icp.disable-cache">ICPFilter</a>
	  to disable caching of documents retreived through ICP</li>
	<li>JSDK/1.0 FCS servlet API support</li>
	<li>Powerful JDBC access through server side include.
	  <p><br>
	    This new feature allow you to querty any JDBC compliant database and embed
	    the result within your HTML page. Check the <a
	      href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.ssi.SSIResource.html">SSIResource api</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>PICS &amp; JDBC.
	  <p><br>
	    A new LabelBureau implementation is available. It relies on any JDBC
	    compliant database as the storage mechanism for PICS labels, which makes
	    it more scaleable than the previous filesystem based approach.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Servlet support has been upgraded to 1.0FCS; Support for automatic
	  servlet reloading has also been implemented (Jigsaw will detect that the
	  servlet class files have changed and will reload them automatically).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>New Features</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>Added a companion server to do the remote configuration.
	  <p><br>
	    The protocol used to communicate with the Admin servlet hasn't been
	    specified yet, and will probably change in the next releases of Jigsaw.
	    The client part of the API (<a
	      href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.admin.RemoteResource.html">w3c.jigsaw.jigadm.RemoteResource</a>)
	    is unlikely to change though.</p>
	</li>
	<li>A new graphical tool is available to do the configuration of Jigsaw.
	  Currently, this allows you to do everything the form based editor could
	  do.</li>
	<li>Support for the <a href="User/api/Package-w3c.www.sap.html">SAP</a>
	  protocol has been included, as the starting point for multicast
	  proxy-to-proxy support. SAP is the Session Announcement Protocol (an
	  Internet draft)</li>
	<li>The <a
	    href="User/Reference/w3c.jigsaw.proxy.ProxyDirectory.html">ProxyDirectory</a>
	  resource now supports ftp tunneling (it won't do caching until someone
	  tells me how ftp results can be cached)</li>
	<li>Support for a light multicasted version of ICP now available in the
	  proxy, turn your hundreds of useless 5Mo caches into a usefull 50Mo
	  collaborative proxy: <i>the net is the computer</i> ! Check the <a
	    href="User/Reference/w3c.www.protocol.http.micp.MICPFilter.html">MICPFilter</a>
	  client side filter.</li>
	<li>Resource can now be extended through the use of <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.tools.store.ResourceFrame.html">ResourceFrame</a>;
	  <p><br>
	    The notion of HTTP filters has proven usefull enough to be extended for
	    non HTTP resources. You can now attach <i>frames</i> to resources that
	    describe users for example (such as the w3c.jigsaw.auth.AuthUser).</p>
	</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Incompatible API changes</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>The <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.forms.FormResource.html">FormResource</a>
	  constructor now takes a ResourceContext instead of a httpd instance</li>
	<li>The indexing model haa changed quite a bit.
	  <p><br>
	    A new indexing model has been designed: each directory can declare how it
	    indexes its content through thew use of its own indexer. The indexer API
	    is defined in w3c.jigsaw.indexer.</p>
	</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Incompatible Configuration Changes</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>Filters pickling as attributes
	  <p><br>
	    Filters pickling has changed: filters are now just a special resource
	    attribute, and follow the general pickling format. They used to be
	    special, and that caused lots of troubles. <br>
	    <i>Don't redefine the pickle method !!</i></p>
	</li>
	<li>Cache directory hierarchy
	  <p><br>
	    The cache directory hierarchy has been made multi-directory: cached
	    entries are stored in a tree of directories instead of within a single
	    directory (lessen the load on the file system by decreasing the acche
	    directory size)</p>
	</li>
      </ul>

      <h2><a name="1.0alpha5"></a>Jigsaw 1.0alpha5</h2>
      <b>A public release made on February the 13th, 1997.</b>

      <h3>Incompatible changes</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>The <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.tools.store.AttributeHolder.html">AttributeHolder</a>
	  <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.tools.store.AttributeHolder.html#unpickle">unpickle</a>
	  and <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.tools.store.AttributeHolder.html#unpickleInstance">unpickleInstance</a>
	  methods, now take a third boolean parameter, that indicates if the
	  resource is to be initialized after unpickling. <b>Warning</b> if you have
	  written an 1.0alpha3 resource that redefines this method, you should make
	  sure to define the new format for this method (since it's the one that
	  gets called by the unpickling engine)</li>
	<li>The <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.www.http.HttpReplyMessage.html">HttpReplyMessage</a> <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.www.http.HttpReplyMessage.html#setLocation">setLocation</a>
	  method now takes an URL, to reflect the fact that HTTP/1.1 specification
	  requires an absolute URL here.</li>
	<li>The getURL method of <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.HTTPResource.html">HTTPResource</a>
	  has now been splitted into two diferent methods:
	  <dl>
	    <dt>String <a
		href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.HTTPResource.html#getURLPath">getURLPath</a>()</dt>
	    <dd>Returns the path of the URL of the resource (as a String)</dd>
	    <dt>URL <a
		href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.HTTPResource.html#getURL">getURL</a>(request)</dt>
	    <dd>Retuns the full URL of the resource. With virtual hosting support,
	      it may happen that a resource has differnt URLs according to the
	      incomming requests, that's one of the reason for that split.</dd>
	  </dl>
	</li>
	<li><a
	    href="User/api/w3c.tools.store.AttributeHolderAttribute.html">AttributeHolderAttribute</a>
	  semantics has slightly changed: it is up to resources using that kind of
	  attribute to initialize the value (if any) of that attribute, by calling
	  their <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.tools.store.AttributeHolder.html#initialize">initialize</a>
	  method with appropriate default values.</li>
	<li>Resources can now refuse unloading, through the new <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.tools.store.Resource.html#acceptUnload">acceptUnload</a>
	  method. This allows to <i>lock</i> a resource in memory, whatever happens.
	  This should be use only with great care.</li>
	<li>The <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.tools.store.ResourceStoreHolder.html">ResourceStoreHolder</a>
	  interface has changed in the following ways:
	  <dl>
	    <dt>notifyStoreUnload</dt>
	    <dd>Has been renamed to <a
		href="User/api/w3c.tools.store.ResourceStoreHolder.html#acceptUnload">acceptStoreUnload</a>,
	      and returns a boolean that indicates wether the store holder is
	      willing to get rid of any of its references to the store. If any of
	      that store holders return <b>false</b> the store will not ne
	      unloaded.</dd>
	    <dt><a
		href="User/api/w3c.tools.store.ResourceStoreHolder.html#notifyStoreShutdown">notifyStoreShutdown</a>
	      and <a
		href="User/api/w3c.tools.store.ResourceStoreHolder.html#notifyStoreStabilize">notifyStoreStabilize</a></dt>
	    <dd>Semantics has been slightly changed: it is nolonger up to the
	      store holder to perform the job. The first method is the one in
	      which the holder should get rid of all its references to the store
	      (by nullifying them), and the second one is just a
	      notification.</dd>
	  </dl>
	</li>
	<li>The <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.ContainerResource.html">ContainerResource</a>
	  <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.ContainerResource.html#lookupStore">lookupStore</a>
	  method now throws an <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.InvalidResourceException.html">InvalidResourceException</a>
	  if the resource exists in its store but cannot be restored. In such a
	  case, the <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.DirectoryResource.html">DirectoryResource</a>
	  will emit an appropriate error message.</li>
	<li>The <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.daemon.ServerHandler.html">ServerHandler</a>
	  interface <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.daemon.ServerHandler.html#initialize">initialize</a>
	  and <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.daemon.ServerHandler.html#clone">clone</a>
	  methods now provide a pointer to the <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.daemon.ServerHandlerManager.html">ServerHandlerManager</a>
	  as a first parameter.</li>
	<li>The resource and resource store APIs have been moved outside of
	  <b>Jigsaw</b>. After a year of experimentation, this code has proven
	  usefull outside the scope of the server itself, that's why we decided to
	  move it to a newly created package <a
	    href="User/api/Package-w3c.tools.store.html">w3c.tools.store</a>. If you
	  have written some resources, the only change for you will be to import
	  that new package in your class files. The precise list of classes that has
	  moved is:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Attribute.java</li>
	    <li>AttributeHolder.java</li>
	    <li>AttributeHolderAttribute.java</li>
	    <li>AttributeRegistry.java</li>
	    <li>BooleanAttribute.java</li>
	    <li>ClassAttribute.java</li>
	    <li>DateAttribute.java</li>
	    <li>DoubleAttribute.java</li>
	    <li>FileAttribute.java</li>
	    <li>FilenameAttribute.java</li>
	    <li>HolderInitException.java</li>
	    <li>IllegalAttributeAccess.java</li>
	    <li>IntegerArrayAttribute.java</li>
	    <li>IntegerAttribute.java</li>
	    <li>InvalidResourceAttribute.java</li>
	    <li>LongAttribute.java</li>
	    <li>ObjectAttribute.java</li>
	    <li>PropertiesAttribute.java</li>
	    <li>Resource.java</li>
	    <li>ResourceLocker.java</li>
	    <li>ResourceShadower.java</li>
	    <li>ResourceStore.java</li>
	    <li>ResourceStoreHolder.java</li>
	    <li>ResourceStoreManager.java</li>
	    <li>SimpleResourceStore.java</li>
	    <li>StringArrayAttribute.java</li>
	    <li>StringAttribute.java</li>
	    <li>UnknownResourceException.java</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>The <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.tools.store.ResourceStoreManager.html">ResourceStoreManager</a>
	  <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.tools.store.ResourceStoreManager.html#unpickleProlog">unpickleProlog</a>
	  method no longer returns a boolean. Instead it throws one of:
	  <dl>
	    <dt><a
		href="User/api/w3c.tools.store.NotAStoreException.html">NotAStoreException</a></dt>
	    <dd>If the file preambule doesn't match the store cookie.</dd>
	    <dt><a
		href="User/api/w3c.tools.store.InvalidStoreClassException.html">InvalidStoreClassException</a></dt>
	    <dd>If the class willing to load that repository doesn't match the
	      class that saved it.</dd>
	    <dt><a
		href="User/api/w3c.tools.store.InvalidStoreVersionException.html">InvalidStoreVersionException</a></dt>
	    <dd>If the repository version doesn't match the loading class
	      version.</dd>
	  </dl>
	</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Compatible changes</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>HTTPResource defines a new <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.HTTPResource.html#verify">verify</a>
	  method, that might be called by a resource store salvager to check the
	  consistency of the resource.For example, file system based resources will
	  use that method to check that the file or directory they wrap still exist,
	  and delete themselves if not.</li>
	<li><a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.DirectoryResource.html">DirectoryResource</a>
	  listing now emits HTML3.2 compliant documents, along with a link to the
	  container (when possible)</li>
	<li>The realms catalog no longer uses absolute pathes, it will not however
	  upgrade all realms catalog to not using absolute path. Relative path are
	  relative to the server's auth directory (typically
	  <tt>config/auth</tt>)</li>
	<li>The <tt>w3c.jigsaw.space</tt> property is no longer settable through the
	  Admin properties editor. This was an oversight. The only way to set the
	  <i>space</i> for a server, is through the <tt>-space</tt> commandline
	  toggle (check the <a href="User/Administration/cmdline.html">command line
	    page </a>for more details)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>New features</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>A new <a
	    href="User/Reference/w3c.jigsaw.contrib.SalvagerResource.html">SalvagerResource</a>&nbsp;
	  has been written. This resource will walk through the entire resource
	  space, to check for:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Cycles in resource stores (due to <b>Jigsaw</b> bugs)</li>
	    <li>Unused resource stores (it garbage collects the stores)</li>
	    <li>Synchronize resources with the file system, by calling the <a
		href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.HTTPResource.html#verify">verify</a>
	      method of all resources.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>A new <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.tools.store.ResourceWalker.html">ResourceWalker</a>
	  interface is available, along with a <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.tools.store.WalkerEngine.html">WalkerEngine</a>. These
	  two classes provide respectively an interface to handle the walk, and an
	  <i>engine</i> that will trigger call to implementors of previous interface
	  while walking through a resource space.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Bug fixes</h3>

      <p>Numerous bug fixes have been omitted from the list, that list only the main
	ones:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>The <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.tools.store.ResourceStoreManager.html">ResourceStoreManager</a>
	  had numerous bugs, most of them should now be fixed.</li>
	<li>The <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.www.protocol.http.icp.ICPFilter.html">ICPFilter</a>
	  HTTP client side filter that implements the Internet Cache Protocol should
	  now be compatible with Squid implementations</li>
	<li>CVS has been fixed in numerous ways; the PutList resource should now be
	  usable.</li>
	<li>The basic class <a
	    href="User/Reference/w3c.jigsaw.auth.AuthFilter.html">AuthFilter</a> now
	  performs authentication during lookup, rather then at
	  <tt>ingoingFilter</tt>'s time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2><a name="1.0alpha4"></a>Jigsaw 1.0alpha4</h2>
      <b>A member specific release, made on January the 13th, 1997.</b>

      <h3>Incompatible changes</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>Properties are no longer saved in a single file, each <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.daemon.ServerHandler.html">ServerHandler</a> has
	  to manage its own property file. The file is designated through the server
	  <i>identifier</i>. This means that older <tt>httpd.props</tt> file should
	  be changed by:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Renaming them to <tt>http-server.props</tt> (the default server
	      identifier)</li>
	    <li>All properties prefix should be removed (ie all <tt>http-server</tt>
	      prefixes)</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>The AttributeHolder pickling format has changed:
	  <ul>
	    <li>The FilteredResource pickling method had a bug (it didn't conform to
	      the general format)</li>
	    <li>Before being dumped, attribute values are prefixed by theire pickled
	      length. This allows the unpickleInstance method to skip unknown (ie
	      deleted) attributes.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>The <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.daemon.DaemonProperties.html">DaemonProperty</a>
	  class is now only used as a property loader. It implements a catalog of
	  property sets; each <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.daemon.ServerHandler.html">ServerHandler</a>
	  instance is responsible for managing its own <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.util.ObservableProperties.html">ObservableProperties</a>
	  instance.</li>
	<li>The <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.HTTPResource.html#getURL">getURL</a>
	  method of User <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.HTTPResource.html">HTTPResource</a>
	  instances now return the full path of the resource within any of the
	  server contexts (it used to return the full URL).</li>
	<li>The abstract <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.Attribute.html">Attribute</a> class
	  now defines a new <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.Attribute.html#getPickleLength">getPickleLength</a>
	  abstract method (that has to be defined by sub-classes). This method is
	  used for the new pickling format of resources, to allow the unpickle
	  method to skip unknown attribute values.</li>
	<li>The <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.ResourceStore.html">ResourceStore</a>
	  API has changed (for ResourceStore implementers only). The <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.ResourceStore.html#getVersion">getVersion</a>
	  method has been added, and must return the version of the class that
	  implements the store.
	  <p><br>
	    The <a
	      href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.ResourceStore.html#initialize">initialize</a>
	    method has a new opaque <i>token</i> parameter, to be used by the store
	    when calling back the resource store manager (eg when calling the
	    markModified method). The <i>token</i> can be thought of as the identity,
	    for the resource store manager, of the store.</p>
	</li>
	<li>The <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.www.protocol.http.HttpManager.html">HttpManager</a> can
	  now be instantiated several times within the same process. This allows for
	  different context for the HTTP client side API. More precisely, the new
	  method <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.www.protocol.http.HttpManager.html#getManager(Properties)">getManager(Properties
	    props)</a> will create a new manager if no other manager has been created
	  with that exact property set.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Bug fixes</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>The <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.http.CommonLogger.html">CommonLogger</a> now
	  initializes its buffer size properly from properties.</li>
	<li>Several fixes in the <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.www.protocol.http.cache.CacheFilter.html">CacheFilter</a>
	  (protocol implementation errors)</li>
	<li>Bug fixes in the server-side <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.http.Request.html">Request</a> object, wouldn't
	  allow for non persistent connections.</li>
	<li>The new <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.http.socket.SocketClientFactory.html">SocketClientFactory</a>
	  now properly deletes old clients if needed (old clients would otherwise
	  tend to be priviledged wr to newer ones).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>New features</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>Created the <a
	    href="User/Reference/w3c.jigsaw.contrib.PasswordEditor.html">w3c.jigsaw.contrib.PasswordEditor</a>
	  resource, that allows web site users to change their own password within a
	  given realm.</li>
	<li>Created the <a
	    href="User/Reference/w3c.jigsaw.contrib.CheckpointResource.html">w3c.jigsaw.contrib.CheckpointResource</a>
	  that will backup <b>Jigsaw</b> configuration every once in a while.</li>
	<li>Created the <a
	    href="User/Reference/w3c.jigsaw.contrib.LogFilter.html">w3c.jigsaw.contrib.LogFilter</a>
	  filter, that allows for very flexible monitoring of an URL sub-space.</li>
	<li>Added UNIX specific command line options, to be able to run
	  <b>Jigsaw</b> on port 80, as any user, under any groups. Support also
	  provided for chroot'ing <b>Jigsaw</b> under UNIX, check <a
	    href="User/FAQ.html#chroot">the FAQ entry</a>.</li>
	<li>The proxy now provides minimal support for ICP, through the <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.www.protocol.http.proxy.ICPFilter.html">ICPFilter</a>.</li>
	<li>Sun's servlet API is now supported, servlets can be downloaded from the
	  net ! Check the <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.servlet.ServletWrapper.html">ServletWrapper</a>
	  and <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.servlet.RemoteServletWrapper.html">RemoteServletWrapper</a>
	  resources.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Compatible API Changes</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>the <a href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.http.Client.html">Client</a> <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.http.Client.html#getOutputStream">getOutputStream</a>
	  method now returns a DataOutputStream.</li>
	<li>Revamped ClientPool, Client into abstract classes, etc. Check the new <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.http.Client.html">Client</a> and <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.http.ClientFactory.html">ClientFactory</a> APIs.
	  This dos <i>not</i> affect any of the resources, but a set of properties
	  did change in this process. All properties starting with
	  <tt>w3c.jigsaw.ClientPool</tt> are now changed, check the <a
	    href="User/Reference/w3c.jigsaw.http.socket.SocketConnectionProp.html">SocketConnectionProp</a>
	  resource for more infos.</li>
	<li>The <a href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.http.httpd.html">httpd</a> class now
	  has an a new errlog method, to signal error in a homogeneous way from
	  resources (it takes a resource and a message as a paragmeter):
	  <p><br>
	    <tt>errlog(HTTPResource resource, String msg</tt>)</p>
	</li>
	<li>The <a href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.http.Logger.html#sync">Logger</a>
	  interface now define a <tt>sync</tt> method for asking the loggers to
	  flush whatever they have back to disk.</li>
	<li>The <a href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.Resource.html">Resource</a>
	  object defines a new <b>store-entry</b> attribute, to be used by the store
	  of that resource as a closure (typically caching resource stores have an
	  entry for each loaded resource to keep track of lockers, etc). The
	  ResourceStore interface has been changed to reflect this: all methods that
	  used to take a resource identifier as a parametr can now take the resource
	  instead, and find up the entry through that new attribute.</li>
	<li>The <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.DirectoryResource.html">DirectoryResource</a>
	  class functionalities has been splitted into two sub-classes:
	  <dl>
	    <dt><a
		href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.StoreContainer.html">StoreContainer</a></dt>
	    <dd>Defines a basic resource container, that keeps track of its
	      children through a resource store. It doesn't know nothing about a
	      file system</dd>
	    <dt><a
		href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.DirectoryResource.html">DirectoryResource</a></dt>
	    <dd>Now extends the StoreContainer, and knows how to serve files from
	      a file-system.</dd>
	  </dl>
	</li>
	<li>The <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.ContainerResource.html">ContainerResource</a>
	  for registering children, <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.ContainerResource.html#registerResource">registerResource</a>,
	  now take as a parameter an HTTPResource instead of a Resource.</li>
	<li>The <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.HTTPResource.html#perform">HTTPResource</a>
	  perform method has been splitted into three separate stages, to allow for
	  more flexible customization of the process of performing a request:
	  <dl>
	    <dt><a
		href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.HTTPResource.html#filterIn">filterIn</a></dt>
	    <dd>Applies all the filters on the way in, before the request gets
	      processed. If this method returns a non-null Reply, it is assumed
	      that some filter knew how to generate a reply on behalf of the
	      target resource (eg a RAMCacheFilter)</dd>
	    <dt><a
		href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.HTTPResource.html#dispatch">dispatch</a></dt>
	    <dd>Dispatches the well-known HTTP methods (ie GET, POST, PUT, etc) to
	      the appropaite Java methods (ie get, post, put...)</dd>
	    <dt><a
		href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.HTTPResource.html#filterOut">filterOut</a></dt>
	    <dd>Applies all filters on the way out. If this method returns a
	      non-null reply, it is assumed to subsume the original reply (as
	      obtained by calling dispatch).</dd>
	  </dl>
	</li>
      </ul>

      <h2><a name="1.0alpha3"></a>Jigsaw 1.0alpha3</h2>
      <b>A public release, made on October 7th, 1996.</b>

      <p>This release is mainly a bug fix release with regard to the <a
	  href="#1.0alpha2">1.0alpha2</a> release.</p>

      <h3>Bug fixes</h3>

      <p>Main bug fixes are:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>The HTTP client side code has been reworked. This shouldn't affect users
	  of that package, since it is mainly a rewritting of the internals of the
	  HttpManager. The main problem was the managing of persistent connections,
	  which is now much enhanced. The code was also cleaned up in that
	  process.</li>
	<li>The cache garbage collector really works now ! The 1.0alpha2 cache
	  garbage collector was just a proof of concept. The new garbage collector
	  works by <i>chunking</i> the flow of data being cache through generation
	  numbers, which allows for a much more precise garbage collections.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>New features</h3>

      <p>A small set of enhancements has been made too:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Virtual hosts capabilities have been added, this feature supports only
	  the <tt>Host</tt> based version of that feature (which doesn't consume IP
	  addresses). More documentation is available <a
	    href="User/Reference/w3c.jigsaw.resources.VirtualHostResource.html">here</a>.</li>
	<li>The <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.ContainerResource.html">ContainerResource</a>
	  is now an abstract class, much more suitable for sub-classing then the <a
	    href="User/api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.DirectoryResource.html">DirectoryResource</a>.</li>
	<li>The <a
	    href="User/Reference/w3c.jigsaw.proxy.ProxyDirectory.html">ProxyDirectory</a>
	  now has a <i>disconnected</i> mode, which allows you to connect your
	  laptop from the net, get any numbers of document, disconnect from the net
	  to later browse while on a trip. Check it !</li>
	<li>A new <a
	    href="User/Reference/w3c.jigsaw.proxy.MirrorDirectory.html">MirrorDirectory</a>&nbsp;
	  resource has been added, that allows you to <i>mirror</i> any web site.
	  This resources is a nifty subclass of the newly created <a
	    href="User/Reference/w3c.jigsaw.proxy.ForwardDirectory.html">ForwardDirectory</a>
	  resource.</li>
      </ul>
