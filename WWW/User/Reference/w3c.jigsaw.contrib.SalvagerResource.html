  SalvagerResource
</H1>
<P>
This resource is used to check the consistency of the entire resource space.
It also tries to fix problems encountered. It works by walking through the
entire resource space (by running within a very low priority thread). During
this walk, the salvager can encounter several problems:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Cycles within the resource space; these are usually due to old (or unknown)
    implementation bugs
  <LI>
    Unloadable resources, either because their class no longer exists, or because
    the server's class path is not set properly
</UL>
<P>
The salvager should be run until both categories of problems are totally
solved; once all the above problems are fixed, you should run the Salvager
once again to perform a <I>verification</I> of the resource space. This time,
each resource is checked to see if it is still consistent for it to exist,
and deleted if needed. This allows, for example, to make sure that files
that have been indexed but which no longer exists are removed from the resource
space.
<P>
Under any circumstances, it is highly recommended that you backup your
configuration (by archiving <B>Jigsaw</B> configuration directory) before
you run the salvager.
