<h1>Understanding the basics...</h1>

<h2>How do I install Jigsaw?</h2>

<p>Get the appropriate package (see <a
href="../FAQ.html#download">FAQ</a>).<em>Then read
the README file from the documentation!</em></p>

<p>Follow the installation instructions (i.e. run the installation
script).</p>

<p>Jigsaw works with a JDK &gt;= 1.2 (since Jigsaw 2.1.0). We recommend the use of a JDK version &gt;= .3 for Jigsaw 2.2.* even if it works with 1.2, otherwise some non-critical functionalities may be available.</p>

<p>Be sure that your
CLASSPATH is set up correctly.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>If you get an error indicating that a class is not found
    (<code>java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError</code>), you probably have a wrong
    CLASSPATH.</li>
  <li>Windows users: if you get an "out of environment space" error, you
    should increase the DOS environment space (see Microsoft knowledge
  base).</li>
</ol>

<h2>What if I want to compile Jigsaw?</h2>

<p>First, be sure that recompilation is <em>really</em> what you want.</p>

<p>Set the appropriate CLASSPATH to use the classes instead of the jar from
the package.</p>

<p><code>CLASSPATH = &lt;instdir&gt;/Jigsaw/src/classes/:...</code></p>

<p>instead of</p>

<p><code>CLASSPATH = &lt;instdir&gt;/Jigsaw/classes/jigsaw.jar:...</code></p>

<p>Of course be sure to add all the external jars needed by your version of
Jigsaw, servlet.jar, sax.jar and xp.jar. Some sources may require additional
packages like jakarta-oro and jtidy.</p>

<p>Then you can use make in any directory
under<code>&lt;instdir&gt;/Jigsaw/src/classes</code>. Another way if you want
to compile everything faster, see this:</p>

<p><code>cd &lt;instdir&gt;/Jigsaw/src/classes &amp;&amp; javac -O `find .
-name \*.java`</code></p>

<p>(Windows Users will uses \ instead of / in paths).</p>

<h2>Let's start running Jigsaw...</h2>

<p>Just type in the following command:</p>

<p><code>cd &lt;instdir&gt;/Jigsaw/Jigsaw<br />
java org.w3c.jigsaw.Main -host host -root
&lt;instdir&gt;/Jigsaw/Jigsaw</code></p>

<p>(Windows Users will uses \ instead of / in paths).</p>

<p>Jigsaw should be running, and will probably have emited a message like:</p>

<p><code>jigsaw Sample/Jigsaw&gt; java org.w3c.jigsaw.Main<br />
loading properties from:<br />
/0/w3c/cbournez/Jigsaw/Jigsaw/config/server.props <br />
*** Warning : JigAdmin[2.2.2]: no logger specified, not logging.<br />
JigAdmin[2.2.2]: serving at http://ender.inria.fr:8009/ <br />
Jigsaw[2.2.2]: serving at http://ender.inria.fr:8001/</code></p>

<h2>Where are the server configuration files?</h2>

<p>Be careful. All the configuration is <em>not</em> handled by plain text
configuration files. There is a slight difference between what is server
Configuration and what is Administration. Configuration includes definition
of basic server properties (such as server root, port, keep alive,
logging,...). All these properties are set in
<code>Jigsaw/config/http-server.props</code>. Administration, on the other
side, deals with the way the resources are served. Jigsaw includes an
Administration server, which has it self properties
(in<code>Jigsaw/config/admin-server.props</code>). It allows to configure
ressources served throught <a
href="./JigAdmin/Overview.html">JigAdmin</a>.
Most of the usual tasks on the server can be completed through the admin
server and JigAdmin. Note that JigAdmin also allows to perform the
admin-server administration tasks as well.</p>

<h2>But what is a resource?</h2>

<p>You can find a designer-friendly description of what a resource is <a
href="../Programmer/design.html#whatr">here</a>.
All what you need to know is that a <strong>resource</strong> is an object
you may want to serve with your Jigsaw server. It can be many kinds of
objects but it is usually a static file or a dynamically generated content.
Here is a summarized list of resources:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><a
  href="../Reference/resources.html#Standard resources">Standard
  resources</a> are basic resources that you expect any server to support
  (files, directories)</dt>
  <dt><a
  href="../Reference/resources.html#Extension resources">Extension
  resources</a> are mainly dynamic content objects (e.g. servlets, ZIP
  archives, directory listing).</dt>
  <dt><a
  href="../Reference/resources.html#Admin resources">Admin
  resources</a> are special resources that allow Jigsaw's administration.</dt>
  <dt><a
  href="../Reference/resources.html#Property resources">Property
  resources</a> are wrappers to subsets of Jigsaw properties, that allow to
  edit these properties.</dt>
</dl>

<p></p>

<p>According to the type of resource, the server will use an appropriate mean
to serve it, which is described by a <strong>frame</strong>. You can find
also a designer-friendly documentation about <a
href="../Programmer/design.html#whatf">frames</a>.
However, here is a summarized view of frames existing in Jigsaw:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><a
  href="../Reference/frames.html#Standard frames">Standard
  frames</a> are HTTP-related frames. They allow the server to serve basic
  resources but also handle redirection, virtual hosting and content
  negotiation.</dt>
  <dt><a
  href="../Reference/frames.html#Extension frames">Extension
  frames</a> are mainly designed to serve dynamic content (CGI, servlets,...)
  but also special resources like CVS or ZIP resources.</dt>
  <dt><a
  href="../Reference/frames.html#Filter frames">Filter
  frames</a> allow you to filter the requests and replies (many different
  usages, e.g. authentication, log, HTTP errors, cache).</dt>
  <dt><a
  href="../Reference/frames.html#Proxy frames">Proxy
  frames</a> are relative to the proxy features of Jigsaw.</dt>
  <dt><a
  href="../Reference/frames.html#Admin frames">Admin
  frames</a> are related to Jigsaw's administration (see Admin
  resources).</dt>
  <dt><a
  href="../Reference/frames.html#Specific frames">Specific
  frames</a> can be attached only to specific resources (there is an explicit
  combination between a resource and a frame, a specific frame won't work
  with any other resource than the one it is made for).</dt>
  <dt><a
  href="../Reference/frames.html#metadata">Metadata
  frames</a> are used to serve and/or store metadata.</dt>
</dl>

<p></p>

<h2>Do I really need to attach a frame to each resource I want to serve?</h2>

<p>Of course the answer is <em>no</em>. The server has a default behaviour
which allows to automagically "configure" the resources with appropriate
frames. This is done by an <a
href="../Programmer/design.html#indexer">indexer</a>.
Of course, you can override or tune this behaviour by changing the default
indexer. For example, you could choose among the various existing indexers
(ContentTypeIndexer, SampleResourceIndexer...). Moreover, you can choose
differents indexers for different subdirectories in your resources
repository. It does <em>not</em> prevent  from configuring manually resources
and frames, even in an indexer's scope. An indexer always leave untouched
manual configurations.</p>

<p>To summarize: the default root for the Jigsaw resource tree is
<code>Jigsaw/WWW/.</code>(Note that in a freshly installed Jigsaw, it is not
empty). If you simply add an HTML file in this directory, the default indexer
will automatically configure a FileResource with an attached HTTPFrame the
first time you will request this file to the server.</p>
