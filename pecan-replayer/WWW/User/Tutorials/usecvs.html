  Editing your web site with Jigsaw
</H1>
<P>
This tutorial is devoted to collaborative editing of your web site through
<B>Jigsaw</B>. The tools described here are still undergoing test, but as
of today, it has been used to edit entirely <B>Jigsaw</B>'s documentation.
<P>
The basic guideline for that project is to <I>avoid</I> reinventing the weel,
by reusing an existing revision control system, namely cvs. The set of resources
described here act as a front end to that tool, and assume a particular
organization of your web site.
<P>
Before reading further, you should be familiar with:
<DL>
  <DT>
    cvs
  <DD>
    GNU's Revision Control System.
  <DT>
    Jigsaw admin
  <DD>
    The configuration process of <B>Jigsaw</B>. You should at least have a good
    understanding of the <A HREF="configuration.html">configuration tutorial</A>.
</DL>
<H2>
  The basic model
</H2>
<P>
As we rely as much as possible on CVS, this first section explains how your
website has to be organized in order to support <B>Jigsaw</B>'s editing
capabilities.
<P>
The idea is for the server space (ie documents served by the server) to be
one "local" cvs space, corresponding to the state of the CVS repository at
<I>publish</I> time. Each user that has authoring access to the site also
has its own "local" space, following CVS conventions. A typicall setting
would be for example:
<DL>
  <DT>
    /usr/local/jigsaw/WWW
  <DD>
    To be a checkeout module of CVS, used by the server to serve documents
  <DT>
    ~fred/WWW
  <DD>
    The "local" CVS space of user <I>fred</I>.
  <DT>
    ~joe/WWW
  <DD>
    The "local" CVS space of user <I>joe</I>.
</DL>
<P>
Two instances of <B>Jigsaw</B> are run: one for editing each user's local
space - we will call it <B>JigEdit</B><I> </I>in the rest of that document,
and the main "public" one for serving the server space. The rest of this
documents describe the tools to be used on <B>JigEdit</B> (the public server
is just a normal server, it can even not be <B>Jigsaw</B>).
<P>
The tools described here provide a mean for each user to keep track of the
documents he/she has edited, to <I>publish</I> them to the public server
(by cvs updating it's space), and to run any CVS command through a form based
interface.
<H2>
  Setting up JigEdit
</H2>
<P>
<B>Jigsaw</B> comes with three tools to support collaborative editing:
<DL>
  <DT>
    A CVS front end
    (<A HREF="../Reference/w3c.jigsaw.cvs.CvsDirectoryResource.html">w3c.jigsaw.cvs.CvsDirectoryResource</A>)
  <DD>
    A single resource, that provides a full featured form based CVS interface
  <DT>
    A AutoLookupDirectory
    (<A HREF="../Reference/w3c.jigsaw.cvs.AutoLookupDirectory.html">w3c.jigsaw.cvs.AutoLookupDirectory</A>)
  <DD>
    That will checkout on-the-fly appropriate directories in particular user's
    space.
  <DT>
    The PutFilter
    (<A HREF="../Reference/w3c.jigsaw.filters.PutList.html">w3c.jigsaw.filters.PutFilter</A>)
  <DD>
    That will keep track of the documents edited by one user, but which have
    not yet been <I>published</I>.
</DL>
<P>
When working in conjunction, these resources and filters provide a way for
each user to edit its own copy of the web site, and to publish (potentially
later on) a set of ready-for-delivery documents.
<P>
To set <B>JigEdit</B> up, the first step is to create a directory template,
mapping all <CODE>CVS</CODE> directories to the CvsDirectoryResource. To
do this, go to /Admin/Directories, and create a non-generic directory template
for directories named <CODE>CVS</CODE>; map them to the
<CODE>w3c.jigsaw.cvs.CvsDirectoryResource</CODE> class.
<P>
Once this is done, you need to <I>register</I> authoring users to
<B>JigEdit</B>. To do so, you must first export their local space to
<B>JigEdit</B>, the best way is to use a
<A HREF="../Reference/w3c.jigsaw.resources.PassDirectory.html">w3c.jigsaw.resources.PassDirectory
</A>resource. 
<P>
Then for each user, create an instance of the PutListResource
(<A HREF="../Reference/w3c.jigsaw.filters.PutListResource.html">w3c.jigsaw.filters.PutListResource</A>)
to keep track of their edits. This resource is fed by the PutList filter
(<A HREF="../Reference/w3c.jigsaw.filters.PutFilter.html">w3c.jigsaw.filters.PutFilter</A>),
that you should plug on each user's top resource. The PutFilter communicates
with the PutListResource, by getting its URL from the <CODE>put-list</CODE>
attribute (which should provide the absolute path of the PutListResource
that handles that user's put list).
