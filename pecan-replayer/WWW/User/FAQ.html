</H3>
<P>
<B>Jigsaw</B> is the new W3C reference server. Its main purpose is to demonstrate
new protocol features as they are defined (such as
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Protocols/">HTTP/1.1</A> or
<A HREF="../../PICS/">PICS</A>), and to provide the basis for experimentations
in the field of server software (such as the provided MUX prototypical
implementation).

<H3>
  <A NAME="java"></A>Why is <B>Jigsaw</B> written in Java ?
</H3>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.javasoft.com/">Java</A> has a number of advantages that
fit well with our purposes. It provides portable threads and garbage collection,
allows for a very dynamic server architecture. It's ability to move code
around may be use in future development to experiment with the mobile code
concept.
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  <A NAME="slow"></A><B>Jigsaw</B> is written in Java, it must be really slow...
</H3>
<P>
No so true ! Check out the
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Jigsaw/User/Introduction/performance.html">performance
evaluation of <B>Jigsaw</B></A>, which indicates that it performs at least
as well as the CERN server.
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  <A NAME="jigsaw-indexing"></A>What is this <I>indexing</I> thing all about
  ?
</H3>
<P>
To a normal HTTP web-admin, <B>Jigsaw</B>'s configuration process might look
really strange...<A HREF="Introduction/wp.html"><B>Jigsaw</B>'s design</A>
emphasis two different processing stage in serving documents:
<DL>
  <DT>
    Indexing stage
  <DD>
    When documents <I>enter</I> the Web
  <DT>
    Serving stage
  <DD>
    When documents are served to clients
</DL>
<P>
In short the rationale for separating these two stages is to make the
<I>serving stage</I> as efficient as possible, by having the <I>indexing
stage</I> prepare as much as possible the work. A document <I>enter</I> the
WEB space the first time <B>Jigsaw</B> serves it; this happen behind the
scene most of the time, and consist in creating a <I>resource</I> for the
document to be served by querying a <I>resource factory</I>. The current
resource factory can be configured to create various kind of resources based
either on the file name extensions, or (in case of a directory) based on
its name.
<P>
However, once a resource is created, it no longer reflects the settings of
the resource factory (available resp. as <TT>/Admin/Extensions</TT> and
<TT>/Admin/Directories</TT>); in some sense the information gets
<I>compiled</I> so that at serving time, processing overhead is reduced as
much as possible.
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  <A NAME="editor"></A>What are all these information in the form based resource
  editor ?
</H3>
<P>
The current version of the generic resource editor is rather terse. At this
point, the resource editor will present all the declared resource attribute
values and some ways to edit them. All the attributes are declared in each
resource <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Jigsaw/User/Reference/">reference
manual</A>.
<P>
Resource editors is an area in which you can expect big improvement in the
next release. Right now, it is recommended that you use two browser windows,
one displaying the form based editor, and the other one displaying the
appropriate reference manual for the resource being edited (which described
all the attributes semantics).
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  <A NAME="authentication"></A>How do I setup authentication ?
</H3>
<P>
Setting up authentication through the form based interface requires you to
run through the following stages:
<OL>
  <LI>
    Create an authentication realm, if required. This is done through the
    <I>Realms</I> resource, usually available as <TT>/Admin/Realms</TT>. You
    can of course reuse authentication realms to protect different areas of the
    server.
  <LI>
    Setup an authentication filter on the appropriate resource. The target of
    the filter can be either a directory resource (in which case the filter will
    protect all the area defined by the sub-resources of this directory resource),
    or any other filtered resource (hence allowing you to protect a single resource).
    Setting up an authentication filter is done by editing the target resource,
    through the generic resource editor. If you want to protect, say &nbsp;the
    <TT>/protected</TT> directory resource, then you have to bring up its editor,
    which will usually be available as <TT>/Admin/Editor/protected</TT>.
  <LI>
    Setup the authentication filter parameters. Once the filter is plugged in,
    you can edit its attribute by clicking on the appropriate link in the bottom
    of the target resource editor.
</OL>
<P>
That's it ! For more information, you may want to read through the
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Jigsaw/User/Tutorials/configuration.html">configuration
tutorial</A>.
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  <A NAME="pass-directory"></A>How do I tie a resource to a directory not under
  my server root?<BR>
  Contributed by <I>Sirilyan &lt;sirilyan@io.com&gt;</I>
</H3>
<P>
CERN server implemented this through the Pass directive, which let you map
a server path to an absolute path on your file system. Jigsaw uses the
w3c.jigsaw.resources.PassDirectory resource.
<P>
COOKBOOK METHOD: Create a new resource with <I>Add resources</I> in the Editor
at the location you want the new server path to exist. Assign whatever name
you desire to the new resource, and assign
<A HREF="Reference/w3c.jigsaw.resources.PassDirectory.html">w3c.jigsaw.resources.PassDirectory</A>
for the class. Edit this new resource to change the pass-target attribute
to the absolute path to the directory you want to serve.
<P>
You may want to change the name attribute of the 'index' file in that directory
to Overview.html. name and filename are two separate attributes in Jigsaw;
this is also a poor man's (or a Win95/NT user's) symlink.
<P>
Serving directories outside your server root may be a security risk.
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  <A NAME="CGI-scripts"></A>How do I setup CGI scripts ?
</H3>
<P>
They are two ways to setup CGI scripts. The manual way requires that you
describe each script to the server. Let's say your script's path relative
to the server root is <TT>WWW/cgi-bin/myscript</TT>. You will first have
to create an appropriate
<A HREF="Reference/w3c.jigsaw.forms.CgiResource.html">w3c.jigsaw.forms.CgiResource</A>
instance to wrap your script, by pointing your browser to the
/Admin/Editor/cgi-bin/ directory resource. Click the <I>Add resource</I>
link, and enter the name under which you wish your script to be seen, and
the
<A HREF="Reference/w3c.jigsaw.forms.CgiResource.html">w3c.jigsaw.forms.CgiResource</A>
as the resource class.
<P>
Then edit the newly created resource, and setup it's command line (the command
line the server will use to run your script). Each line of the text field
should represent one argument, the first one being the script full path.
<P>
You can also register files of a given extension as scripts, by using the
<TT>/Admin/Extensions</TT> extension editor. Say you want to have all
<TT>.pl</TT> files to be exported as&nbsp;perl scripts. Register the extension,
and map it to the
<A HREF="Reference/w3c.jigsaw.forms.CgiResource.html">w3c.jigsaw.forms.CgiResource</A>;
when required, you can even specify the interpreter to be run to execute
the script (for example, &nbsp;under Windows 95, or NT).
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  <A NAME="proxy-config"></A>How do I setup <B>Jigsaw</B> as a proxy ?
</H3>
<P>
Running <B>Jigsaw</B> as a proxy involves the following steps:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Create an instance of the
    <TT><A HREF="Reference/w3c.jigsaw.proxy.ProxyDirectory.html">w3c.jigsaw.proxy.ProxyDirectory</A></TT>
    resource in the root resource store, by pointing your browser to /Admin/Editor
    and selecting the <I>Add resource</I> link. Type in the name of the resource
    (ie <TT>proxy</TT>), and its class
    (<TT>w3c.jigsaw.proxy.ProxyDirectory</TT>). <BR>
    At this point, you will need to edit this resource's attributes. To do so,
    select the <I>Existing Resources</I> link which will display a list of resources
    including the newly created proxy. Follow the <I>proxy</I> link to display
    an editable list of attributes of the proxy resource. You should set the
    <TT>local-root</TT> attribute to the old root resource (ie <TT>root</TT>
    under the default configuration) and select <I>OK</I>. This will make sure
    that requests targeted to the proxy itself will be served by the normal server,
    allowing for access to the configuration.
  <LI>
    Once the new resource is created, set it as the root resource of your server,
    by pointing your browser to /Admin/Properties/general and setting the root
    resource's name property (<TT>w3c.jigsaw.root.name</TT>) to <I>proxy</I>.
    Then select <I>OK</I>.<BR>
    Now point your browser to /Admin/Properties and select the <I>Save
    Properties</I> link.
  <LI>
    <B>Jigsaw</B> is now running as a proxy reconfigure your browser to run it...and
    have fun !
</UL>
<H3>
  <A NAME="extend"></A>How can I extend <B>Jigsaw</B> ?
</H3>
<P>
<B>Jigsaw</B> can be extended in a number of ways. Here are just three possible
things you can play with, from the simplest to the complex ones:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Writing new resource classes: you may want to read the
    <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Jigsaw/User/Tutorials/resource.html">tutorial</A>
    on this subject before getting any further. You can think of this as being
    a n efficient replacement for CGI scripts, although this is a much more powerful
    environment to extend the server.
  <LI>
    Writing new filter classes: if you want to experiment with specific
    authentication needs, or if you require special logging formats. A
    <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Jigsaw/User/Tutorials/filter.html">tutorial</A>
    on writing new filters is also available.
  <LI>
    Hacking <B>Jigsaw</B>. Right now you can just override any of the
    <B>Jigsaw</B> classes to replace its implementation. In the future, most
    of the interesting things that you can do this way will be turned into specific
    interfaces (as is already the case for logging right now).
</UL>
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  <A NAME="persist"></A>Why does <B>Jigsaw</B> implement its own persistence
  mechanism
</H3>
<P>
<B>Jigsaw</B> implements its own persistence mechanism while RMI already
provides a way to serialize objects, why is it so, will it change ? What
<B>Jigsaw</B> implements in the <TT>w3c.tools.store</TT> package is more
then persistence. It provides both a way of serializing objects <I>and</I>
a way of describing what and how the object will be dumped. The available
meta-description of objects (that you can obtain through the
<TT>getAttributes</TT> method of resources), is a central part of
<B>Jigsaw</B> architecture, since it offers the ability to create generic
resource editors. This is not likely to disappear.
<P>
However, <B>Jigsaw</B> persistence mechanism may be merged in the future
to the RMI interface, just by providing an implementation of the
<TT>readObject</TT> and <TT>writeObject</TT> method through its existing
mechanism.
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  <A NAME="client-hotjava"></A>How can I use HotJava on top of Jigsaw's HTTP
  client API ?
</H3>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.javasoft.com/HotJava/index.html">HotJava</A> is Sun's
Java based browser. If you want to experience an HTTP/1.1 compliant browser,
you can run this browser on top of <B>Jigsaw</B>'s HTTP/1.1 compliant HTTP
client API. To do so, you need to define the
<TT>java.protocol.handler.pkgs</TT> property to <TT>w3c.www.protocol
</TT>before launching HotJava. The best way to do so is to edit the HotJava
property files.
<P>
<B>Jigsaw</B>'s HTTP client API defines a number of other properties, if
you are planing to use this setting, you should read the
<A HREF="api/w3c.www.protocol.http.HttpManager.html">HttpManager</A>
documentation to get the complete list of available properties. These will
allow you to add caching, authentication, proxying and more to
<A HREF="http://www.javasoft.com/HotJava/index.html">HotJava</A> !
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  <A NAME="#http-port"></A>Running <B>Jigsaw</B> on port 80 under UNIX
</H3>
<P>
As of release 1.0alpha5, <B>Jigsaw</B> can now run on port 80, without running
as the <I>root</I> user. To implement that you need to install the relevant
piece of native code. This C code has been compiled and tested under Solaris,
porting it to a different platform/architecture should be pretty easy.
<P>
Follow the normal installation procedure, and try to run <B>Jigsaw</B> on
a port greater than 1024. Once this work, stop <B>Jigsaw</B> (through
<TT>/Admin/Exit</TT>), Make sure your LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable includes the
directory containing <TT>libUnix.so</TT> (this is the <TT>Jigsaw/lib</TT>
directory under the standard release).
<P>
Select the user and group you want <B>Jigsaw</B> to run as. Make sure that
user has read/write access to the entire <TT>config</TT> directory. Then,
you just need to run <B>Jigsaw</B> through that special command line:
<P>
<TT>java w3c.jigsaw.Main -user <I>user</I> -group <I>group</I>
&lt;other-options&gt;</TT>
<P>
Where <I>user</I> and <I>group</I> should provide (resp.) the user and the
group you want <B>Jigsaw</B> to run as.
<P>
<B>Warning</B>: As the underlying UNIX process will change personnality right
after acquiring the socket, the form based <I>restart</I> button (available
from the properties editor) will no longer work, since the process will no
longer be able to allocate a socket on port 80. <BR>
Under such a setting, the only way to restart <B>Jigsaw</B> is to kill it
(through <TT>/Admin/Exit</TT>) and restart it manually.
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  <A NAME="chroot"></A>Chrooting <B>Jigsaw</B> under UNIX
</H3>
<P>
As of release 1.0alpha5, <B>Jigsaw</B> can now - under UNIX - be chroot'ed.
If you try to do so, you are supposed to have some experiences with chroot'ing
programs. We will assume that you already have a correct root to run a standard
HTTP server and that you have read and understood the <I>Running Jigsaw on
port 80 </I><A HREF="#http-port">FAQ entry</A>.
<P>
You need to install Java in that root (using whatever prefered way you want).
To install <B>Jigsaw</B>, I would recommend using the following directory
structure:
<DL>
  <DT>
    /usr/local/jigsaw/classes
  <DD>
    Should contain <B>Jigsaw</B>'s current distribution <I>jigsaw.zip</I> class
    file
  <DT>
    /usr/local/jigsaw/extensions
  <DD>
    Is used to add extensions to the server while running, and should be included
    in your CLASSPATH, <I>before</I> you start <B>Jigsaw</B>.
  <DT>
    /usr/local/jigsaw/lib
  <DD>
    Should contain <B>Jigsaw</B>'s native code support &nbsp;- ie
    <I>libUnix.so</I> -(to make the appropriate UNIX system calls)
</DL>
<P>
Given that (don't forget to <I>symlink</I> the real
&nbsp;<TT>/usr/local/jigsaw</TT> to the chroot'ed one), you should be able
to reuse that script:

Servlets are server-side extensions programmed against the
<I><A HREF="http://jeeves.javasoft.com/products/java-server/webserver/fcs/doc/apidoc/packages.html">Servlet
API</A></I>. This interface is philosophically equivalent to the old CGI

<P>
NOTE: The default version of jigsaw has been compiled with servlet support,
to use
<P>
Be sure to have a recent version of the servlet classes. Update your CLASSPATH
to use those classes. Modify the Makefile in src/classes/w3c/jigsaw and add
the servlet package at the end of the PACKAGES list, like this:
<P>
<CODE>contrib \<BR>
upgrade \<BR>
servlet</CODE>
<P>
Then, uncomment the line 144 of w3c/jigsaw/ssi/DefaultCommandRegistry.java
like this:
<P>
<CODE>new w3c.jigsaw.ssi.servlets.ServletCommand()</CODE>
<P>
and adds the servlets package in the Makefile of the w3c.jigsaw.ssi package,
like this:

  <A NAME="install-servlets"></A><B>How do I install a servlet ?</B>
</H3>
<P>
Installing a servlet is pretty easy !
<P>
First of all, you have to choose where you want to place your servlets in
your filesystem; this will usually be a single directory, typically somehting
like <I>servlets</I> under your server's <B>WWW</B> directory. Once you have
created the filsystem directory, create a Jigsaw
<A HREF="Reference/w3c.jigsaw.servlets.ServletDirectory.html">w3c.jigsaw.servlet.ServletDirectory</A>
to export it. That resource will act as a <I>context</I> for all the servlets
under it (Jigsaw can handle multiple servlet contexts within a single server).
You can now add servlets into this special directory. Each servlet is managed
by a
<A HREF="Reference/w3c.jigsaw.servlet.ServletWrapper.html">w3c.jigsaw.servlet.ServletWrapper,</A>
to add a servlet you just have to create a ServletWrapper and in the
<I>servlet-class</I> field put the class name of the servlet witch must be
in the directory relative to the ServletDirectory resource.
<P>
Example :
<P>
You want to install the DateServlet in the WWW/servlets directory:
<OL>
  <LI>
    Create the directory <I>servlets</I> under <B>WWW</B>
  <LI>
    Start the <A HREF="Administration/JigAdm.html">JigAdmin</A> program and unfold
    all the nodes down to the <I>space</I> node.
  <LI>
    Select the <I>space</I> node, and activate the <I>Resources</I> editor helper.
    Enter the ServletDirectory identifier (ie <I>servlets</I>) and the class
    of the resource (ie <I>w3c.jigsaw.servlet.ServletDirectory</I>)
  <LI>
    Put the servlet class (ie <I>DateServlet.class</I>) in WWW/servlets.
  <LI>
    Create a ServletWrapper to the ServletDirectory and call it DateServlet for
    example.
  <LI>
    Set the servlet-class field of the ServletWrapper to DateServlet
  <LI>
    Commit your changes
</OL>

  <A NAME="load-servlets"></A><B>How does Jigsaw load local servlet classes
  ?</B>
</H3>
<P>
Jigsaw use a ServletClassLoader to load servlet classes from the
ServletDirectory. If a servlet class is modified when jigsaw is running,
the ClassLoader look at the last modified date of the class in memory and
the class on the disk and reload the classe if its necessary.

</H3>
<P>
You can use remote servlets by using a RemoteServletWrapper instead of the
ServletWrapper.
<P>
Example : Add the remote servlet
<I>http://www.servlet.com/RemoteServlet.class</I> to jigsaw.
<OL>
  <LI>
    Create the RemoteServletWrapper in the ServletDirectory.
  <LI>
    Set its "servlet-base" field to <I>http://www.servlet.com</I>
  <LI>
    Set its "servlet-class" field to "<I>RemoteServlet</I>" (without .class)
  <LI>
    Commit changes.
</OL>
<P>
Note : the url &nbsp;<I>http://www.servlet.com/RemoteServlet.class</I> must
be a Java compliant class file.
