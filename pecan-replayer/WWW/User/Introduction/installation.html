  Installation Procedure
</H1>
<H3>
  Prerequisite
</H3>
<P>
Before reading further make sure:
<UL>
  <LI>
    That you have downloaded the latest <B>Jigsaw</B> distribution (version 1.0beta)
  <LI>
    That you have downloaded any implementation of <B>Java</B> for your platform
    (<B>Jigsaw</B> 1.0beta will compile and run only with a 1.1 JDK)
  <LI>
    If you're using the zip distribution, make sure it's&nbsp; at least version
    6.x
</UL>
<P>
This document describes how to install <B>Jigsaw</B>. As an example, we are
assuming that you are running either on Windows (be it 95 or NT) or on UNIX,
even though <B>Jigsaw</B> will (should ?) run on <I>any</I> platform that
supports <B>Java</B>.
<P>
The installation process involves the following steps:
<UL>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="#unpack">Unpack the distribution file</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="#env">Set up some environment variables</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="#run">Run <B>Jigsaw</B></A>
</UL>
<H2>
  Note on upgrading (<A HREF="#unpack">skip if not upgrading</A>)
</H2>
<P>
The upgrade may require two steps if you are upgrading from a version earlier
than alpha5. If it is not the case, read the following section, otherwise,
go to the <A HREF="#upgradealpha5">Alpha4 to Alpha5 </A>part before upgrading
to beta.
<H3>
  Upgrade from 1.0alpha5 to 1.0beta<A NAME="upgradebeta"></A><!-- -->
</H3>
<P>
Once again, an automatic upgrade from your old version of <B>Jigsaw</B> has
been provided. During the upgrade process, <B>Jigsaw</B> will give you
information about this upgrade process. Be sure to have the upgrade package
needed for this operation, <TT>upgrade.zip </TT>for Windows,
<TT>upgrade.tar.gz</TT> for UNIX. Those packages are in the
<TT>Jigsaw/upgrade</TT> directory.
<P>
It is strongly recommended to keep a backup of your current configuration.
Backup'ing the configuration can be done using any tools, if <I>INSTDIR</I>
is the place where you installed the previous release of <B>Jigsaw</B>:
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=2 >
  <CAPTION>

  <TR>
    <TD>Windows</TD>
    <TD>cd <I>INSTDIR</I>; zip -r config.zip config</TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
If you use the following instructions, you can re-install using:

  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Windows</TD>
    <TD>cd <I>INSTDIR</I>; unzip config.zip</TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Now, you must install the new configuration files in your configuration
directory, taken from the update zip.
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=2 >
  <CAPTION>
    Installing the new configuration files&nbsp;
  </CAPTION>
  <TR>
    <TD>UNIX</TD>
    <TD>cd <I>INSTDIR/</I>Jigsaw/Jigsaw/config; gzip -c -d upgrade.tar.gz | tar
      xomvf -</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Windows</TD>
    <TD>cd <I>INSTDIR</I>/Jigsaw/Jigsaw/config; unzip upgrade.zip</TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Be careful, if you have already an "admin" realm for your Authentification,
be sure to put back the backuped version. This realm is used by the
administration server.
<P>
To complete the upgrade of <B>Jigsaw</B>, you only have to start jigsaw
(<TT>w3c.jigsaw.Main</TT>). During this last step, <B>Jigsaw</B> will emit
traces of what happened, the result will be stored in
<TT>INSTDIR/Jigsaw/Jigsaw/config/upgrade2to3.txt</TT>. Check this file for
errors.
<H3>
  Upgrade from 1.0alpha4 to 1.0alpha5<A NAME="upgradealpha5"></A><!-- -->
</H3>
<P>
For those of you who have already installed a previous release of
<B>Jigsaw</B>, you should be aware that since version 1.0alpha4,
<B>Jigsaw</B> has a facility for automatically upgrading your configuration
files. You will note that the first time you run a newer release of
<B>Jigsaw</B>, it will tell you about that upgrading process, and how it
goes.
<P>
<B>Note</B>: for the upgrade process to happen, it is <I>mandatory</I> that
you run <B>Jigsaw</B> the old way, through the <TT>w3c.jigsaw.http.httpd</TT>
class. Once the upgrade is done, you can safely start using the modern command
line (ie the <TT>w3c.jigsaw.Main</TT>). That's a bug !
<P>
It is recommended that you keep a backup of the previous configuration, by
packing all the <TT>config</TT> directory in an archive file. Backup'ing
the configuration can be done using any tools, if <I>INSTDIR</I> is the place
where you installed the previous release of <B>Jigsaw</B>:
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=2 >
  <CAPTION>
    Backuping the config&nbsp;
  </CAPTION>
  <TR>
    <TD>UNIX</TD>
    <TD>cd <I>INSTDIR</I>; tar cvf - config &gt; config.tar</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Windows</TD>
    <TD>cd <I>INSTDIR</I>; zip -r config.zip config</TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
If you use the following instructions, you can re-install using:
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=2 >
  <CAPTION>

  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Windows</TD>
    <TD>cd <I>INSTDIR</I>; unzip config.zip</TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Last but not least, once your configuration has been upgraded, you may want
:
<UL>
  <LI>
    To copy the <TT>Jigsaw/Jigsaw/WWW/Admin</TT> directory into your (empty ?)
    <TT>Admin</TT> directory, the <TT>Overview.html</TT> document available there
    provides a nice frame based toolbar.
  <LI>
    To install a
    <TT><A HREF="../Reference/w3c.jigsaw.contrib.SalvagerResource.html">w3c.jigsaw.contrib.SalvagerResource</A></TT>
    and a
    <TT><A HREF="../Reference/w3c.jigsaw.contrib.CheckpointResource.html">w3c.jigsaw.contrib.CheckpointResource</A></TT>
    in your <TT>/Admin</TT> directory
</UL>
<H2>
  <A NAME="unpack"></A>Unpacking the distribution file
</H2>
<P>
Pick a place to unpack the distribution: we'll call this directory the
<I>installation directory</I> (abreviated as&nbsp; <I>INSTDIR</I>). This
can be any directory, you just have to change your current working directory
to it:
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=2 >
  <TR>
    <TD>UNIX</TD>
    <TD><PRE>cd <I>INSTDIR</I>
</PRE>
    </TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Windows</TD>
    <TD><PRE>cd <I>INSTDIR</I>
</PRE>
    </TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Now unpack the file:
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=2 >
  <TR>
    <TD>UNIX</TD>
    <TD><PRE>cat jigsaw.tar.gz | gzip -d | tar xomvf -
</PRE>
    </TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Windows</TD>
    <TD><PRE>unzip jigsaw.zip
</PRE>
    </TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
This will create a number of directories under the <B>Jigsaw</B> directory:
<DL>
  <DT>
    <TT>Jigsaw/src</TT>
  <DD>
    Contains <B>Jigsaw</B> sources.
  <DT>
    <TT>Jigsaw/classes</TT>
  <DD>
    Contains the pre-compiled classes.
  <DT>
    <TT>Jigsaw/lib</TT>
  <DD>
    Contains some native code support for solaris.
  <DT>
    <TT>Jigsaw/Jigsaw</TT>
  <DD>
    Is a sample root directory to run the server in. This directory in turns
    contain the following sub-directories:
    <DL>
      <DT>
	<TT>Jigsaw/Jigsaw/config</TT>
      <DD>
	Is the configuration directory for the server
      <DT>
	<TT>Jigsaw/Jigsaw/logs</TT>
      <DD>
	Is the normal directory for log files
      <DT>
	<TT>Jigsaw/Jigsaw/bin</TT>
      <DD>
	Contains some shell scripts to help you start <B>Jigsaw</B>.
      <DT>
	<TT>Jigsaw/Jigsaw/cache</TT>
      <DD>
	The directory to use for caching when using <B>Jigsaw</B> as a caching proxy.
      <DT>
	<TT>Jigsaw/Jigsaw/WWW</TT>
      <DD>
	Is your exported file space
    </DL>
</DL>
<P>
You are now ready for the next section, which explains how to setup your
environment.
<H2>
  <A NAME="env"></A>Setting up your environment
</H2>
<P>
As <B>Jigsaw</B> is just a set of Java classes, you need to specify to the
Java interpreter the place where <B>Jigsaw</B> classes are stored. This is
usually done by setting some CLASSPATH environment variable. This is simply
done by the following command:
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=2 >
  <TR>
    <TD>UNIX</TD>
    <TD><PRE># This depends on the shell you are using, we're assuming <TT>/bin/sh</TT>
CLASSPATH=<I>INSTDIR</I>/Jigsaw/classes/jigsaw.zip
export CLASSPATH
</PRE>
    </TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Windows</TD>
    <TD><PRE>set CLASSPATH=<I>INSTDIR</I>\Jigsaw\classes\jigsaw.zip
</PRE>
    </TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Don't forget to change <I>INSTDIR</I> with the absolute path of the place
you have unpacked the distribution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should now
be ready to run <B>Jigsaw</B>.
<P>
<B>Warning</B>: on some Windows Java implementation, prefixing the CLASSPATH
with the disk drive letter may cause some confusion. If java complains about
not being able to find some class, you may want to remove the disk drive
letter from the CLASSPATH.
<H2>
  <A NAME="run"></A>Running <B>Jigsaw</B>
</H2>
<P>
You are now all set to run <B>Jigsaw</B>. Just type in the following command:
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=2 >
  <TR>
    <TD>UNIX</TD>
    <TD><PRE>cd <I>INSTDIR</I>/Jigsaw/Jigsaw
java w3c.jigsaw.Main -host<I> host</I> -root <I>INSTDIR</I>/Jigsaw/Jigsaw
</PRE>
    </TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Windows</TD>
    <TD><PRE>cd <I>INSTDIR\</I>Jigsaw\Jigsaw
java w3c.jigsaw.Main -host <I>host</I> -root <I>INSTDIR\</I>Jigsaw\Jigsaw
</PRE>
    </TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Don't forget to susbstitute to <I>INSTDIR</I> the absolute path of the location
where you have unpacked the distribution file, and to <I>host</I> the full
IP hostname of the machine running <B>Jigsaw</B>.
<P>
<B>Jigsaw</B> should be running, and will probably have emited a message
like:
<PRE>www24:Jigsaw$ bin/jigsaw -root `pwd`&nbsp;
loading properties from: /0/w3c/abaird/puzzles/JigEdit/config/server.props
Jigsaw[1.0beta]: serving at http://www43.inria.fr:8009/
</PRE>
<P>
Indicating that it is waiting to meet your browser at the given URL.
<H2>
  Further reading
</H2>
<P>
At this point, it is recommended that you start reading the documentation,
available from your server at <TT>/User</TT> (i.e. in the above example,
the full URL would be <TT>http://www24.w3.org:8001/User</TT>.
<P>
Here is a roadmap to the documentation:
<UL>
  <LI>
    You should first start by reading the <A HREF="architecture.html">architecture
    overview.</A>
  <LI>
    You should then configure your server to meet your need. There are two sources
    of documentation for this stage:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	The <A HREF="../Administration/Overview.html">administration guide</A>
      <LI>
	The <A HREF="../Tutorials/configuration.html">configuration tutorial</A>
      <LI>
	The Jigsaw aministration tool.
    </UL>
  <LI>
    At this point, you should have understood the configuration process, you
    can now browse the rest of the documentation in whatever order you want.
