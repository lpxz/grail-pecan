  Design
</H2>
<P>
The <STRONG>Jigsaw</STRONG> server is entirely written in Java. Because of
this, it offers the following features:
<DL>
  <DT>
    Portable
  <DD>
    <STRONG>Jigsaw</STRONG> will run on all platforms that support Java, with
    <EM>no</EM> changes ! This is for real, it has been tested at least on Windows
    95 and Windows NT.
  <DT>
    Extensible
  <DD>
    <STRONG>Jigsaw</STRONG> is made of a core and a set of extension modules.
    You can add your own modules, <EM>dynamically</EM>, to the server. Moreover,
    because the Java runtime comes with both threads and garbage collection,
    your job as an extension writter is largely simplified.
  <DT>
    Object Oriented
  <DD>
    The full code of the server is object-oriented, but the interesting thing
    is that resources <EM>are objects</EM>. By opposition to most of the existing
    servers, that consider a resource as being either a <B>cgi script</B> or
    a <B>file</B>, <STRONG>Jigsaw</STRONG> allows <EM>any</EM> object to become
    accessible through HTTP.
</DL>
<H2>
  Table of content
</H2>
<P>
<B>Jigsaw</B> user's guide is made of the following material:
<DL>
  <DT>
    <B><A HREF="Introduction/Overview.html">Presentation</A></B>
  <DD>
    A quick overview at the <B>Jigsaw</B> architecture. This is a good starting
    point if you want to either use or extend <B>Jigsaw</B>. It will explains
    you the basic design.
  <DT>
    <A HREF="Administration/Overview.html"><B>Jigsaw</B> administration guide</A>
  <DD>
    The thing you want to read if you are planning to use <B>Jigsaw</B> as your
    HTTP server. This will explain you how to configure <B>Jigsaw</B>.
  <DT>
    <A HREF="Tutorials/Overview.html"><B>Jigsaw</B> tutorials</A>
  <DD>
    Three tutorials, that explain you how to run and configure <B>Jigsaw</B>,
    how to extend by by writing new resources, and how to extend it by writing
    new filters.
  <DT>
    <A HREF="Reference/Overview.html"><B>Jigsaw</B> reference manual</A>
  <DD>
    The reference documentation for all <B>Jigsaw</B> objects. This includes
    reference documentation for the set of Java properties used by the server,
    the set of pre-defined resources and the set of pre-defined filters.
  <DT>
    <A HREF="api/packages.html"><B>Jigsaw</B> application programming interface</A>
  <DD>
    The thing you want to read if you plan to extend <B>Jigsaw</B> with new
    functionalities. This includes writing new resource objects (a kind of CGI
    in the server), changing the default logger, etc.
</DL>
<P>
They should be read in this order: it is recommeneded to be able to configure
<B>Jigsaw</B> before trying to extend it !
