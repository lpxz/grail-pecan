  Jigsaw Administration Tools
</H1>
<P>
There are, since <B>Jigsaw</B> 1.0beta, two different ways of administrating
your server. The first one is the oldest one and is a per-server administration
scheme, using HTML and
<A HREF="../Tutorials/configuration.html#global-configuration">form-based
editors</A>. <BR>
The new one is a graphical interface which communicate with an Administration
server, called <B>JigAdmin Server</B>. This server can administer multiple
Jigsaw servers running on the same machine, provided these servers has been
launched at the same time (means by the same java VM), we will call this
graphical interface <B>JigAdmin</B>.
<P>
To use JigAdmin, follow one of these link:

</UL>

  <A NAME="Running">Running JigAdmin</A>

<H3>
  JigAdmin Server
</H3>
<P>
This is very easy in fact. The default configuration files provided both
by the upgrade of an earlier <B>Jigsaw</B> or by the default installation
are designed to start two server, an instance of <B>Jigsaw</B> and one
<B>JigAdmin Server</B>. The default port of <B>JigAdmin Server</B> is 8009.
When you start the server with:
<P>
<CODE>java w3c.jigsaw.Main</CODE>
<P>
You must see, among the trace, &nbsp;this output:
<P>
<CODE>JigAdmin[1.0alpha]: serving at http://tarantula.inria.fr:8009/</CODE>
<H3>
  JigAdmin Client
</H3>
<P>
Now that the administration server is running, you can access it with the
following command:
<P>
<CODE>java w3c.jigadm.Main [-root root] [url]</CODE>
<P>
The default root is your current directory, so if you are in the same directory
where you started <B>Jigsaw</B>, you don't need the "-root" option.<BR>
If you are running the administration server on the same machine, using the
default port 8009, you don't need to provide an URL. The URL is the one of
the administration server.
<H2>
  <A NAME="Using">Using JigAdmin</A>
</H2>
<H3>
  Authentification
</H3>
<P>
To access the administration server, you need to be authentificated for obvious
reasons.<BR>
The realm used to access the server is "admin", the default user is "admin"
and the default password is also "admin". After the first authentification,
modify the user ot the password or both to avoid unwanted changes to your
server!
<P>
Now a new frame should popup and you must see this:
<P>
<IMG SRC="jigadm1.gif" WIDTH="130" HEIGHT="119" ALT="jigadm default screen">
<P>
You are now ready to navigate through the server and configure your servers!
<H3>
  The administration zone
</H3>
<P>
Expand the first node by clicking on the small icon. You must see something
like this:
<P>
<IMG SRC="jigadm2.gif" WIDTH="130" HEIGHT="133" ALT="first node expansion">
<P>
The "control" resource is used to control the server, the control resource
of "Root" means that it controls the administration server itself.
<P>
The "http-server" resource is the first server administrated by <B>JigAdmin
Server</B>. It corresponds to the server with the properties located in
<CODE>http-server.props</CODE>.
<P>
The "realms" resource is used to allow access to the authentification realms
used by the server. The "realms" resource of "Root" allows you to edit, modify
or add new users to access <B>JigAdmin Server</B>.
<H3>
  The server zone
</H3>
<P>
Expand one of the server node (in the default configuration, you will only
have one server to edit: http-server). You must now see something like this:
<P>
<IMG SRC="jigadm3.gif" WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="171" ALT="after expansion of a server node">
<P>
The "control" resource has the same meaning and same role as in the
administration zone.
<P>
The "indexers" resource is used to add, delete or edit the indexers of the
server. Read more about <A HREF="../Introduction/indexer.html">indexers</A>
to understand how to edit them.
<P>
The "properties" resource corresponds to the general properties of
<B>Jigsaw</B>. Read more about <A HREF="propeditor.html">properties</A> to
understand how to edit them. It correspond to the old
<CODE>/Admin/Properties</CODE> directory of the form based editor.
<P>
The "realms" resource is also the same as in the administration zone.
<P>
The "space" resource correspond to the root resource of your server. Under
"space" you will find the resources actually served by <B>Jigsaw</B>. It
is the place to go if you want to add, delete or edit resources, add, delete
or edit&nbsp;filters and so on.
<H3>
  <A NAME="navigate">Note on the tree browser</A>
</H3>
<H4>
  Navigation helps
</H4>
<P>
To expand or collapse a node, you must click on the icon.<BR>
To edit a resource, you must click on the label, the label will become magenta,
like this:
<P>
<IMG SRC="jigadm4.gif" WIDTH="172" HEIGHT="176" ALT="selected node">
<P>
The menu "Admin-Server" has the following capabilities:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Open - Go to another <B>JigAdmin Server</B>
  <LI>
    Open in new window - same as open, but in a new window
  <LI>
    Close window
  <LI>
    Exit - close all windows and exit
</UL>
