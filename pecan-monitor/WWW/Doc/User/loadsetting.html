    <P>Here we describe the use of the four sliders used in the 
      SocketConnectionProp to tune <STRONG>Jigsaw</STRONG> according to the
      load level of your server.<P>
      This document has the following sections:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	<A href="#L179">Client handling</A>
      <LI>
	<A href="#L186">Load map</A>

    <!-- background and samll explanations -->
    <H1>
      Client handling<A name="L179"></A>
    </H1>
    <P>When a browser connects to <STRONG>Jigsaw</STRONG>, it will create a 
      new connection, called "Client" in the server, this Client is taken 
      from the pool of free clients of the SocketConnectionFactory.<p>
    <P>The client may be used for multiple request on the same connection,
      "keep-alive" connections are handled by the factory, instead of using
      fixed timeouts, thus allowing better control of the load and a better
      handling of persistent connections.</p>
    <P>There are two lists used by the factory:
    <dl>
      <dt>Free Clients</dt>
      <dd>The list of free clients, clients are created on the fly, but
	instead of going through the expensive creation process, they are
	stored when they are available. A new client is always added to this 
	list first before being used.<dd>
      <dt>Idle Clients</dt>
      <dd>The list of idle clients, the clients already bound to a connection
	in "keep-alive" mode and waiting for a new request on this connection.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>The number of Clients is limited, so are the number of free clients and
      idle clients. The repartition of the clients on those lists depends on
      the load of the server and the settings, the server will adapt its 
      behaviour depending on those settings.

      <!-- load repartition according to client states -->
    <H1>
      Load map<A name="L186"></A>
    </H1>
    <P>The load map is:</p>
    <img src="load" alt="Server load map">
    <p>This is the behaviour as of <strong>Jigsaw 2.0.3</strong>, it may be
      modified to enhance the smoothness of the server.<br>
      The "Dead" level is obtained when the number of free clients is 0.

      <!-- server behaviour depending on server load -->

    <h1>
      Load level behaviour<A name="#L228"></A>
    </h1>
    <p>Depending on the load level, the server will have a different behaviour.
      Here is a small description of what happens:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Light
      <dd>New clients are always accepted
      <dt>Average
      <dd>New clients are accepted, and some idle clients are shut down.
	The number of idle clients that will be shut down is the amount to
	set the freeCount to maxFree.
      <dt>High
      <dd>Same as average, but the "accept thread" priority is lowered, so that
	"clients" may finish their job first.
      <dt>Dead
      <dd>Connections are refused (Overloaded entries in the errlog).
    </dl>
    <p>A good tool to see the number of established connection to your machine
      is "netstat". If you have statistics on the usage and the maximal number
      of established connections, using a very large configuration, you may 
      then adjust the settings to lower the resources used.<p>
    <p>Rules of thumb:
    <ul>
      <li>maxClients - maxFree should be close to the maximum of established 
	connections, (usually a bell curve on a week day).
      <li>more soon ;)
    </ul>
