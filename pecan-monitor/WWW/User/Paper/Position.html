  Jigsaw, An Object-Oriented Web server
</H1>
<P>
<I>Anselm Baird-Smith &lt;abaird@w3.org&gt;,<BR>

  <A NAME="introduction">Introduction</A>
</H2>
<P>
Most HTTP servers today, are tuned to serve files. This intimate relationship
&nbsp;between HTTP servers and their underlying file system has always affected
their design in significant ways: the mapping from URL to their target resource
generally relies on the file system hierarchy and the configuration information
are generally understood as global to the whole server, or in some cases
<I>per directory</I>, but no server today, allows you to fully configure
your server on a <I>per-resource</I> basis.
<P>
In designing <B>Jigsaw</B>, the new experimental server from the World-Wide-Web
consortium (written in Java), we took the opportunity of starting from scratch
to test a new approach: <I>each exported resource is a full object</I>. This
paper will briefly explain the <I>Resource</I> concept of <B>Jigsaw</B> and
its configuration process.
<H2>
  <A NAME=resources>Resources</A>
</H2>
<P>
<B>Jigsaw</B> is made of two different modules: the <I>server engine</I>
deals with incoming connections, decoding requests and presenting them to
the <I>resource module</I> which will perform them and produce either reply
or error messages. The connection between these modules is described by an
interface, so that you can replace them if needed. We will focus here on
our sample implementation of the resource module.
<H3>
  What are <I>resources</I>
</H3>
<P>
In the HTTP specification, a resource is described &nbsp;as "An network data
object or service which can be identified by a URI". The <B>Jigsaw</B> design
takes these words for truth: each resource is an object inheriting from the
<CODE>Resource</CODE> class. As such, they have an associated behavior, and
some internal state:
<UL>
  <LI>
    The <I>behavior</I> of a resource is defined by its Java class (any subclass
    of <CODE>Resource</CODE>). At this basic level, no particular requirements
    are made on the behavior of a resource: it can define whatever methods it
    wants.
  <LI>
    The <I>internal state</I> of a resource is a set of <I>attributes</I>. Attributes
    have an associated description which indicates their name, how their values
    should be saved to persistent storage, how they are restored from persistent
    storage, and enough type information to be able to edit them.
</UL>
<P>
An <CODE>HTTPResource</CODE>, is a resource tuned to handle the HTTP protocol:
it inherits from the <CODE>Resource</CODE> class the ability to be saved
and restored from persistent storage, along with the ability to describe
and access its internal state. At this level of the class hierarchy, resources
are able to handle an HTTP request by generating an appropriate Reply object:
they can be plugged into the <I>server engine</I>. The set of attributes
defined by the <CODE>HTTPResource</CODE> class is made of:
<DL>
  <DT>
  <DT>
    Content language
  <DD>
    The language tag of the resource, describing the natural languages in which
    the content of the resource is emitted
  <DT>
    Content length
  <DD>
    The length of the content of the resource
  <DT>
    Content type
  <DD>
    The type of the content of the resource (e.g. <CODE>text/html</CODE>)
  <DT>
    Expires
  <DD>
    The date at which the resource expires
  <DT>
    Icon
  <DD>
    Any icon associated with this resource.
  <DT>
    Last modified
  <DD>
    The date of the last modification of the resource
  <DT>
    Quality
  <DD>
    A floating point number in the range <CODE>[0,1]</CODE>, indicating the quality
    of the content of the resource
  <DT>
    Title
  <DD>
    The title of the resource
</DL>
<P>
None of these attributes are mandatory: resources that generate their content
dynamically, for example, might not have a predefined
<CODE>content-length</CODE> or <CODE>content-type</CODE>; A resource whose
content is negotiated will dynamically generate its <CODE>quality</CODE>
attribute (typically by using the quality attribute of the selected variant).
<H3>
  Jigsaw resource class hierarchy
</H3>
<P>
Although object oriented, we still want <B>Jigsaw</B> to be able to - at
least - provide the basic functionality of a Web server: serve files in a
filesystem hierarchy. This is handled by two particular sub-classes of
<CODE>HTTPResource</CODE>: The <CODE>DirectoryResource</CODE> class handles
file system directories and the <CODE>FileResource</CODE> handles files.
<P>
The <CODE>DirectoryResource</CODE> class inherits from the
<CODE>ContainerResource</CODE> class the ability to manage a set of children
resources. This last class specifies how resources are looked-up. The basic
algorithm is the following: parse the requested URL into a sequence of
components, then take the first of them, look it up in the server's root
<CODE>ContainerResource</CODE> instance to obtain a target resource. If they
are no more components to look up, then the target is the target for the
URL, otherwise, the target should be itself a <CODE>ContainerResource</CODE>,
to which we delegate the lookup of the remaining components. This lookup
process takes a time proportional to the number of components in the requested
URL, however, one can define its own <CODE>ContainerResource</CODE> subclass,
and override the lookup algorithm all together.
<P>
The <CODE>DirectoryResource</CODE> maintains a <CODE>ResourceStore</CODE>
to keep track of its children. This resource store manages the pickled version
of each child, which is unpickled on-demand when looked-up. An optional
<CODE>ResourceStoreManager</CODE> instance will keep track of accesses to
loaded resource stores, in order to remove from memory the ones that have
not been used for a while.
<P>
Most children of a directory resource instance will be
<CODE>FileResource</CODE> instances. The file resource class defines the
<CODE>head</CODE>, <CODE>get</CODE>&nbsp;and optionally the <CODE>put</CODE>
methods. For the sake of efficiency, the file resource (optionally) caches
the <CODE>content-length </CODE>and <CODE>last-modified</CODE> attributes
(which it gets from the file system), so that <I>if-modified-since</I> request
can be handled without any disk accesses.
<P>
These two classes, defines 90 percent of what a Web server is expected to
do: serve files of some underlying file system. <B>Jigsaw</B> provides more
resources: the <CODE>PostableResource</CODE> class is a basic class for handling
the &nbsp;HTML form's POST method, the <CODE>CGIResource</CODE> class handles
CGI scripts, etc. Of course, the server maintainer has the ability to defines
its own resource sub-classes, and install instances of them as children of,
for example, some <CODE>DirectoryResource</CODE> instance. This results in
a very flexible server extension API. Again <B>Jigsaw</B> provides some basic
packages of classes to help you here, the <B>form</B> package, for example,
provides a high level API to manage HTML forms, allowing you to register
fields of given types, etc.
<H3>
  Resource filters
</H3>
<P>
We have briefly described the basic design of <B>Jigsaw</B> and explained
how it allows for common server features. However, at this point, one might
wonder how authentication is handled.
<P>
<B>Jigsaw</B> defines another important subclass of <CODE>Resource</CODE>:
the <CODE>FilteredResource</CODE> class. Both the
<CODE>ContainerResource</CODE> class and the <CODE>FileResource</CODE> class
inherit from this new class, which provides the ability to filter requests
to some particular target, or set of targets. A <CODE>ResourceFilter</CODE>
is itself a resource (i.e. it has its own class, and it defines its own set
of attributes). Instances of <CODE>ResourceFilter</CODE> are attached to
a particular <CODE>FilteredResource</CODE> instance, and filtersall access
to them: at lookup stage, the filter's <CODE>ingoingFilter</CODE> method
is called with the request as the only parameter, and on the way back, its
<CODE>outgoingFilter</CODE> method is (optionally) called with both the request
and the target generated reply.
<P>
Given this, authentication is implemented as a special filter, whose
<CODE>ingoingFilter</CODE> method will authenticate the given request, using
whatever algorithm it wants. <B>Jigsaw</B> provides one
<CODE>GenericAuthFilter</CODE> class that allows to authenticate requests
by IP addresses, using the Basic authentication scheme or the Digest
authentication scheme, or a mix of the first with one of the others.
<P>
The concept of filters allows for much more than just authentication. Also
provided are a <CODE>DebugFilter</CODE> (that will print requests and replies
to some given target) and an <CODE>AccessLimitFilter</CODE> (that will limit
the number of simultaneous requests to some targets). Logging can be implemented
as filters too resulting in a powerful mean of getting detailed logging
information for only a sub-space of the whole information space exported
by the server. A <CODE>PICSFilter</CODE> has also been integrated into
<B>Jigsaw</B>, allowing it to serve
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/PICS/">PICS</A> rating labels with documents.
<H2>
  <A NAME=configuration>Configuration</A>
</H2>
<H3>
  Mapping files to resources, editing resource attributes
</H3>
<P>
At this point, one might wonder how all these objects are created. The
configuration process for <B>Jigsaw</B> was probably one of the most challenging
problem (it is responsible for at least three of the entire re-design of
<B>Jigsaw</B>). The main problem is the following: server administrators
are used to configure their whole server through one single centralized
configuration file, while for <B>Jigsaw</B> <I>each</I> resource might need
some specific information. There are two central pieces to the actual solution
we have tested:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Resource meta description: as we have mentioned previously, each attribute
    of a resource has an associated meta description, from which one should be
    able to at-least deduce a generic editor for this attribute values.
  <LI>
    The lazy resource indexer. To help server administrators, <B>Jigsaw</B> defines
    a special class that will try to create a resource instance suitable to export
    a given directory, or given file. This creation process takes place <I>only
    once</I> in the whole lifetime of the server (resource persists across
    <B>Jigsaw</B> invocations).
</UL>
<P>
The first piece allows for the editing of resource attributes, which is one
part of the configuration process. The current version of <B>Jigsaw</B> comes
with a generic form based editor that allows you to edit any resource on
the server. Although not very user-friendly, this generic editor is mainly
a proof of concept. It should be noted here, that this provides for a very
fine-grain configuration: one is able, for example, to say that the file
<CODE>/pub/foo.html</CODE>'s content type is <CODE>text/plain</CODE> and
not <CODE>text/html</CODE>.
<P>
The second piece tackles with the creation process of resource
instances&nbsp;associated with directories or files. One trivial way to cope
with this would be to ask for the server administrator to declare each files
of its system, along with the requested information (e.g. the class of the
resource to be created for the file, the file's attributes, etc.). This,
of course, is not acceptable. By default (this can be turned off) the
<CODE>DirectoryResource</CODE> class implements lookup in the following way:
it first looks in its resource store for the given child, if this fails,
it then goes to the resource indexer, and asks it for a default resource
instance to export the file. The sample resource indexer can be configured
to create particular instances of resource sub-classes based on the file's
extension, or if the file is a directory, on its name.
<H3>
  Global server configuration
</H3>
<P>
<B>Jigsaw</B>'s configuration is not only made of its information space
configuration: one would like to be able to configure the resource indexer,
the&nbsp;authentication realms or the global server properties (such as its
port number, etc.). One nice thing about the <B>Jigsaw</B> design, is that
if you represent these configuration &nbsp;information as instances of
sub-classes of the <CODE>Resource</CODE> class, then they will inherit
persistency, caching and the ability to be edited (which is really what you
want).
<P>
Due to this, the current <B>Jigsaw</B> release provides form-based edition
of the following pieces:
<UL>
  <LI>
    The resource indexer can be configured through forms: you can declare &nbsp;how
    file's of a &nbsp;given extension are to be mapped to resources, and provide
    a default set of attribute values for these newly created resources.
  <LI>
    Authentication realms are editable through forms too, along with each of
    the users they define.
</UL>
<P>
You can, in fact, install and configure <B>Jigsaw</B> without having a text
editor.
<H2>
  <A NAME=conclusion>Conclusion</A>
</H2>
<P>
We have briefly described <B>Jigsaw</B> architecture, and have shown how
an object based server can implement the basic functionalities expected from
a Web server, and more. We believe that the most important characteristics
of our design are:
<DL>
  <DT>
    Persistency of resource instances
  <DD>
    Web objects should be think of as persistent objects right from the begining:
    they have to persist across server invocation (e.g. the server should be
    able to pickle and unpickle them as needed).
  <DT>
    Edition of resource instances
  <DD>
    The configuration of <B>Jigsaw </B>&nbsp;is done through the edition of resource
    attributes. <B>Jigsaw</B> 's design emphasis on this by having each resource
    embedding a description of itself.
</DL>
<P>
Other design considerations have played an important role in <B>Jigsaw</B>'s
design, in particular the ability to unpickle resources only on-demand (so
that the server don't start by unpickling its whole information space), and
the caching mechanism for managing the number of unpickled resources at a
given time. To conclude, we would like to emphasis on the fact that given
this design, <B>Jigsaw</B>'s configuration is no more in one single configuration
file, but rather spread across the various resources instances.
<P>
<B>Jigsaw</B> is still in its alpha stage, and will be available to members
by May, and to the public by June.
