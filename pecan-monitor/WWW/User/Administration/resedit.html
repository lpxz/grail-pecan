  <B>Jigsaw </B>generic resource editors
</H1>
<P>
<B>Jigsaw</B> uses the meta-resource description to generate automatically
editors for specific resources.The generated editors actually uses HTML form,
although this may change in the future. The fact that these editors are
automatically generated makes them share the same user interface, which we
describe in this document.
<P>
To give some insights about how the resource editors work, we will describe
two representative instances of them: the <A HREF="#file-resource">FileResource
editor</A>, and the <A HREF="#directory-resource">DirectoryResource</A> editor.
<H2>
  <A NAME="file-resource">The FileResource editor</A>
</H2>
<P>
While reading this section, it might be a good idea to have another window
displaying the
<A HREF="../Reference/w3c.jigsaw.resources.FileResource.html">FileResource
reference documentation</A>. You might also want to browse around its
<A HREF="../api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.FileResource.html">api documentation</A>.
<P>
We will start by showing a screen dump of the file resource editor (this
screen dump has been generated out of the document you get when you point
your browser to <CODE>/User/Overview.html</CODE>).
<P>
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING="2">
  <TR>
    <TD><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="redit.gif" ALT="" WIDTH="410" HEIGHT="549"></TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
If you have read <A HREF="propeditor.html">the administration guide for the
property editor</A>, this may sound familiar to you. Anyway, we'll re-describe
the general layout of the form here. The form is made of three distinct zones:
<UL>
  <LI>
    The first zone (the form <I>header</I>), is the title section. For all editors,
    this section will always include at least, the name of the resource being
    edited (here, <I>Overview.html</I>), and its resource class
    (<CODE>w3c.jigsaw.resources.FileResource</CODE>).
  <LI>
    The second zone (the <I>form card zone</I>) contains the actual data to be
    edited. Here, the editor displays the resource attributes (check the
    <A HREF="../Reference/w3c.jigsaw.resources.FileResource.html">FileResource
    reference guide</A>)
  <LI>
    The last zone contains a number of links: each link points to another <I>form
    card zone</I> that will allow you to edit another set of characteristic of
    the resource. For an unfiltered file resource, the only other available card
    is the one that allows you to add a new filter.
</UL>
<P>
Just being curious, you may want to follow the <I>AddFilter</I> link, which
should popup a form similar to the one below:
<P>
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING="2">
  <TR>
    <TD><IMG BORDER="0" ALIGN="Middle" SRC="rfedit.gif" ALT="" WIDTH="411" HEIGHT="199"></TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
The <I>form card zone</I> has changed, it now displays an area were you can
type in the class of the filter you want to add (see the
<A HREF="../Reference/filters.html">reference manual on filters </A>for the
xhaustive list of them). Note also that the last zone now displays only an
<I>Attribute</I> link, that you may follow to go back to the previous form
card. Let's continue here by adding a filter to the
<CODE>/User/Overview.html</CODE> resource. We'll just add a
<A HREF="../Reference/w3c.jigsaw.filters.CounterFilter.html">CounterFilter</A>
(a filter that counts the number of hits to some resource). We tyoe in the
filter's class name <CODE>w3c.jigsaw.filters.CounterFilter</CODE>, and press
the <I>OK</I> button. Here is the new form that you get back:
<P>
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING="2">
  <TR>
    <TD><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="rfadd.gif" WIDTH="408" HEIGHT="193"></TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Notice the two new links at the bottom of the form: they allow you to
respectively edit the filter attributes, and the attribute values the filter
shadows for its target (see the
<A HREF="../Introduction/architecture.html"><B>Jigsaw</B> architectural
overview</A> for more informations on shadowed attribute values).
<P>
By now, you should know enough to use the generic editor. You may want to
remove the CounterFilter filter from the <CODE>/User/Overview.html</CODE>
resource, by following the <I>w3c.jigsaw.filters.CounterFilter</I> link,
and pressing the <I>Remove</I> button that will appear here.
<H2>
  <A NAME="directory-resource">The DirectoryResource editor</A>
</H2>
<P>
You may now want to have two additional windows, one displaying the
<A HREF="../Reference/w3c.jigsaw.resources.DirectoryResource.html">DirectoryResource
reference guide</A>, and the other displaying the DirectoryResource api
documentation.
<P>
The directory resource editor is very similar to the file resource editor,
however, it provides two additional form cards to display (and modify) its
existing children resources, and to add new children resources. To get acquainted
with these two new kind of forms, we will pop up the directory resource editor
on the <CODE>/User</CODE> resource (which is a DirectoryResource instance).
By pointing your browser to <CODE>/Admin/Editor/User</CODE>, and following
the <I>ExistingResources</I> link you should get the following (and now familiar)
form:
<P>
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING="2">
  <TR>
    <TD><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="dedit.gif" ALT="" WIDTH="348" HEIGHT="408"></TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
We still have our three zones, the title zone indicates that we are editing
a DirectoryResource whose name is <CODE>User</CODE>. The bottom zone shows
the usual navigation links. The form card zone, however, now displays the
list of children resources of the directory resource. You can follow any
of the links to edit the corresponding resource. There is also a new
<I>Command</I> field, to indicate what operations you want to perform on
the marked children resources. To mark a resource, click on the checkbox
at the right of its name. You can then execute one of the selected command
by pressing the <I>OK</I> button. The <B>update</B> command will update any
attribute that depends on the wrapped file content, the <B>remove</B> command
will delete the resource (but <I>not</I> the underlying file), and the
<B>reindex</B> command will re-run the
<A HREF="../Introduction/indexer.html">resource factory </A>to make it create
a new resource for the wrapped file (this is usefull if you have changed
your resource factory configuration).
<P>
By following the <I>AddingResource</I> link, you will get the following form:
<P>
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING="2">
  <TR>
    <TD><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="dadd.gif" ALT="" WIDTH="358" HEIGHT="316"></TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
This form prompts you for a resource name, and a resource class (consult
the reference manual for the <A HREF="../Reference/resources.html">list of
available resources</A>). Fill both of them to create a new resource, and
press the <I>OK</I> button: the new resource is created, and you will be
relocated to a suitable editor of it.
