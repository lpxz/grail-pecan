  Jigsaw resource's filter tutorial
</H1>
<P>
This tutorial assumes that your are familiar with
<A HREF="../Introduction/architecture.html"><B>Jigsaw</B> architecture</A>,
and that you have read both the
<A HREF="configuration.html">configuration</A> and the
<A HREF="resource.html">resource</A> tutorials. It will explain you the last
major concept of <B>Jigsaw</B> you should be aware of: resource filters.
<P>
As was said in the architectural overview of <B>Jigsaw</B>, each HTTP request
ends up performed by some target resource instance. For the sake of simplicity,
we didn't mentioned at that time, that most resource classes provided with
the <B>Jigsaw</B> server inherits from the
<A HREF="../api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.FilteredResource.html">FilteredResource</A>
class. All instances of this class are able to manage a set of filters: these
filters, which are to be instances of sub-classes of
<A HREF="../api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.ResourceFilter.html">ResourceFilter</A>,
are called-back twice during request processing:
<UL>
  <LI>
    During lookup: before the actual target of the request has been selected.
    The
    <CODE><A HREF="../api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.ResourceFilter.html#ingoingFilter">ingoingFilter</A></CODE>
    method of the filter gets called with the request as a parameter.
  <LI>
    After the request has been processed by the target resource. The
    <CODE>outgoingFilter</CODE> of the filter gets called with the request and
    the reply as parameters.
</UL>
<P>
A resource filter is itself a resource: this means, in particular, that it
is described - like all other resources - by a Java class, and a set of
attributes. It also means that it can be pickled/unpickled, etc.
<P>
The remaining of this tutorial will walk through the code of the
<A HREF="../api/w3c.jigsaw.filters.CounterFilter.html">CounterFilter</A>.
This filter just counts the number of hits to its target resource. Before
going any further, you should again make sure you have understand the
<A HREF="resource.html">resource tutorial</A>. This tutorial has two sections:
<A HREF="#counter-filter">the first one </A>will describe our filter's code,
and the <A HREF="#installing">second one</A> will explain how to attach it
to a target resource.
<H2>
  <A NAME="counter-filter">The CounterFilter class</A>
</H2>
<P>
Its my hope that you will be amazed by how easy this filter is to code. As
for writing new resource classes, the first thing we need to is to define
the set of attributes that our filter will handle. In the case of a simple
counter filter, the only attribute we need is simply the counter itself.
Assuming we want our class to be in the <CODE>w3c.jigsaw.filters</CODE> package,
we start by writing the following piece of code:
<P>
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING="2">
  <TR>
    <TD><PRE><B>package <A HREF="../api/Package-w3c.jigsaw.filters.html">w3c.jigsaw.filters</A>;</B>

<B>import <A HREF="../api/Package-w3c.jigsaw.resources.html">w3c.jigsaw.resources</A>.*;</B>

<B>public class CounterFilter extends <A HREF="../api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.ResourceFilter.html">ResourceFilter</A> {</B>
<B>    /**</B>
<B>     * Attribute index - The counter attribute.</B>
<B>     */</B>
<B>    protected static int ATTR_COUNTER = -1 ;</B>

<B>    static {</B>
<B>        <A HREF="../api/w3c.tools.store.Attribute.html">Attribute</A> a   = null ;</B>
<B>        Class     cls = null ;</B>
<B>        </B>
<B>        try {</B>
<B>            cls = Class.forName("w3c.jigsaw.filters.CounterFilter") ;</B>
<B>        } catch (Exception ex) {</B>
<B>            ex.printStackTrace() ;</B>
<B>            System.exit(1) ;</B>
<B>        }</B>
<B>        // Declare the counter attribute</B>
<B>        a = new <A HREF="../api/w3c.tools.store..IntegerAttribute.html">IntegerAttribute</A>("counter"</B>
<B>                                 , new Integer(0)</B>
<B>                                 , Attribute.EDITABLE) ;</B>
<B>        ATTR_COUNTER = <A HREF="../api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.AttributeRegistry.html">AttributeRegistry</A>.registerAttribute(cls, a) ;</B>
<B>    }</B>
<B>}</B>
</PRE>
    </TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
This code does the following: it starts by declaring our resource filter
class, and specify (through the <CODE>static</CODE> statement) its counter
attribute, which is an editable integer attribute, whose default value is
<B>0</B>. We register this attribute to the AttributeRegistry, and get back
the <I>token</I> for accessing the attribute. If some of this seems unfamiliar,
then refer to the <A HREF="resource.html">resource tutorial</A>.
<P>
We can now implement the <CODE>ingoingFilter</CODE> method of our filter,
which is as simple as you might expect:

</TABLE>
<P>
<I>That's all !</I> However, this needs a bit more explanations. First of
all, you might be surprised that we didn't provide an implementation for
the <CODE>outgoingFilter</CODE> method. There is two reasons for this: the
first one is that our super-class provide an empty
<CODE>outgoingFilter</CODE> method, this solves the compiler problem. The
second one is that as you might have noticed, our <CODE>ingoingFilter</CODE>
returns a special integer,
<A HREF="../api/w3c.jigsaw.resources.ResourceFilter.html#DontCallOutgoing">DontCallOutgoing</A>.
This integers tells the target filtered resource that the filter has performed
all its tasks in the <CODE>ingoingFilter</CODE> method, so there is no need
to call its <CODE>outgoingFilter</CODE> method.
<P>
Note that the counter value will be made persistent across servers invocation
by the <B>Jigsaw</B> runtime. To be clear, this means that you can shutdown
the server, and restart it: the count will keep up to date. Now, enough coding,
let's play with our filter, the next section explains how to attach an instance
of the filter to some target resource.
<H2>
  <A NAME="installing">Installing the filter</A>
</H2>
<P>
First, let's decide on some resource we want to count access to. For the
sake of simplicity, let's say we want to count the number of accesses to
the <CODE>/User</CODE> directory resource. As you might have guess, the first
thing we want to do is to point our favorite browser to
<CODE>/Admin/Editor/User</CODE>. This, as expected, brings up the form to
edit the <CODE>/User</CODE> directory resource. We follow the
<I>AddFilter</I> link at the bottom of the page, which prompts us for the
filter's class. We fill this with
<CODE>w3c.jigsaw.filters.CounterFilter</CODE>, and press the <I>OK</I> button.
The <CODE>/User</CODE> directory resource editor now has two more link (at
the bottom of the page), we follow the <I>w3c.jigsaw.filter.CounterFilter</I>
one, to customize our filter attributes. The count is <B>0</B>, and we don't
care about the filter's name.
<P>
Now, we can access <CODE>/User</CODE> (point your browser to
<CODE>/User</CODE>). Reload the filter's editor...the value is still
<B>0</B>, however, internally the value is now <B>1</B>. To check this, restart
the server (by using the <CODE>/Admin/PropertiesEditor</CODE> <I>restart</I>
button). NOTE: form some reason, the editor of a resource doesn't update
the attribute value it displays when they change behind the scene, this is
why you still see the count has being <B>0</B>. This should be fixed really
soon.

<P>
If you want to understand better the concept of filters, then you can look
at the available filters, here is a path (by increasing complexity):
<UL>
  <LI>
    Start by reading the code of the
    <A HREF="../api/w3c.jigsaw.filters.DebugFilter.html">DebugFilter</A>. This
    one has an <CODE>outgoingFilter</CODE> method, and doesn't represent a
    significant step in complexity.
  <LI>
    You can then try to read the code of the
    <A HREF="../api/w3c.jigsaw.filters.AccessLimitFilter.html">AccessLimitFilter</A>.
    It doesn't use more features then the one above, but the synchronized methods
    it relies on are significantly more complex then the previous to examples.
  <LI>
    Now, if you are courageous enough, you can go to the
    <A HREF="../api/w3c.jigsaw.auth.GenericAuthFilter.html">GenericAuthFilter</A>.
    Once you have understand this one, then you can carry on with the following
    lists of possible filters (left as an exercise to the reader)
  <LI>
    Try to write a filter that will log the referer field of the requests (this
    can be pretty easy if done in the naive way, and can become much complex
    if you want to use a something more efficient).
