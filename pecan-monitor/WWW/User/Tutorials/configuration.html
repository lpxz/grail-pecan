  <B>Jigsaw</B> configuration tutorial
</H1>
<P>
This tutorial will walk through the whole <B>Jigsaw</B> configuration process.
It only assumes that you have unpacked the distribution, it will then take
you through the following steps:
<UL>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="#running">Running <B>Jigsaw</B>, along with some trouble shooting,</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="#global-configuration">Configuring the server, by editing its
    properties,</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="#factory-configuration">Configuring the resource factory databases</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="#editing">Editing existing resources</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="#authentication">Setting up authentication</A>
</UL>
<P>
It is recommended, however, that before reading this tutorial, you read the
brief overview of <A HREF="../Introduction/architecture.html"><B>Jigsaw</B>
architecture</A>.
<P>
Note also that a new configuration tool,
<B><A HREF="../Administration/JigAdm.html">JigAdmin</A></B>, has been provided
to make the configuration of <B>Jigsaw</B> easier, and more understandable.
Of course, reading this tutorial is still very useful!
<H2>
  <A NAME="running">Running <B>Jigsaw</B></A>
</H2>
<P>
<B>Jigsaw</B> distribution comes with a sample root directory. The very first
thing to do, is to check that it runs properly in this directory, for this
purpose, just run the following command (it should work on any platform that
supports Java):
<P>
For version 1.0alpha5 and up:
<P>
j<CODE>ava w3c.jigsaw.Main -root <I>root</I> </CODE>
<P>
For version 1.0alpha4 and lower:
<P>
<CODE>java w3c.jigsaw.http.httpd -host <I>host</I> -port <I>port</I> -root
<I>root</I></CODE>
<P>
You should substitute:
<UL>
  <LI>
    <I>host</I> with the full IP host name of your machine,
  <LI>
    <I>port</I> with the port you want the server to listen to (defaults to 8001),
  <LI>
    <I>root</I> with the distribution sample root directory (e.g.
    <CODE>.../Jigsaw/Jigsaw</CODE>)
</UL>
<P>
If everything runs smoothly, then <B>Jigsaw</B> will print the following
message:
<PRE>loading properties from: /afs/w3.org/usr/abaird/Jigsaw/config/httpd.props
Jigsaw[1.0alpha3]: serving at http://www24.w3.org:8888
</PRE>
<P>
Meaning that the server is ready, and listening at the given URL. If things
do not run as nicely, here is a list of possible hints:
<UL>
  <LI>
    If the command line exits, saying that it can't find the class
    <CODE>w3c.jigsaw.http.httpd</CODE>, this means that your CLASSPATH environment
    variable is not set correctly. Be sure to include in this variable the
    <CODE>.../Jigsaw/classes/jigsaw.zip</CODE> file (were the <CODE>...</CODE>
    stands for the absolute path of the directory in which you have unpacked
    the distribution).
  <LI>
    If the command line exits, saying that it was unable to restore the root
    resource, then, check the value of the <CODE>-root</CODE> command line toggle.
</UL>
<P>
We are now assuming that <B>Jigsaw</B> is running in its sample root directory.
If you want to run <B>Jigsaw</B> in some other place then its sample root
directory, you just need to copy it to the appropriate location (using a
recursive copy program, so that you get the sub-directories too).
<P>
The sample root directory provides a set of resources (located in the
<CODE>Admin</CODE> directory) that allows you to configure the server. As
this directory doesn't come protected by default, you should continue to
read this tutorial until you have protected it (you can jump directly to
the <A HREF="#authentication">authentication section</A>, but it is recommended
that you keep reading until reaching it).
<H2>
  <A NAME="global-configuration">Global configuration</A>
</H2>
<P>
Tired of writing all these command line arguments when running <B>Jigsaw</B>
? In this section, we will explain how to edit the server global configuration,
which will allow you to save your default settings.
<P>
Point your favorite browser to <CODE>/Admin/Properties</CODE>. This page
has a number of links that points &nbsp; <B>Jigsaw</B> module. At this stage,
the first thing you want to do, is to save the actual settings: the command
line flags all end up modifying the properties, so what you see is the correct
set of properties (since you have provided the appropriate command line flags,
e.g. <CODE>-host</CODE>, <CODE>-port</CODE>, etc.), but these are not consistent
with the default property files. Save the properties by clicking the
<I>Save</I> link. You can now play around, and change your settings as needed.
<P>
Note that some settings require a server restart (e.g. changing the server's
port number). In such cases, you will be notified of the need of a server
restart through an appropriate message. You <I>need not</I> (and shouldn't)
save the properties before restarting the server (so that you can check them
before actually saving them), however, once the server has restarted, and
if you find these settings convenient, then you should save them by going
back to the properties editor, and clicking the <I>Save</I> button.
<P>
Let's say, for example, that you want to turn the server in <I>trace</I>
mode. You will first set the server's trace flag to <B>true</B>, then go
to the <I>connections</I> property sheet, and turn the connection
<I>trace</I> flag to <B>true</B> too. Don't save the properties yet, but
restart the server. During its restart the server will first emit a message
saying that it has shutdown itself, and then emit a second message saying
that it has initialized itself. The server now runs in trace mode (i.e. it
will display requests and replies). If you want this change to be persistent
(i.e. always run the server in trace mode), then go back to the properties
editor, and <I>Save</I> the properties.
<P>
In some cases, after you change some properties, the server won't be able
to restart (because the new settings are inconsistent). In this case, just
restart the server manually (through the command line): this will make it
read its settings from the unchanged properties.
<H2>
  <A NAME="factory-configuration">Resources configuration</A>
</H2>
<P>
At this point, <B>Jigsaw</B> should be running, and its global configuration
should be up to date. You may want to check that everything is fine by visiting
some of the documents under the <B>Jigsaw</B> space directory (the
<CODE>WWW</CODE> directory by default). You can read the documentation, for
example, starting from <CODE>/User/Overview.html</CODE>.
<P>
This section will explain how you can <A HREF="#factory-extensions">declare
new file extensions</A> (the usual <CODE>AddType</CODE> directive of servers),
and how you can create <A HREF="#factory-templates">directory templates</A>
.
<H3>
  Describing files by extensions
</H3>
<P>
To export any piece of information, <B>Jigsaw</B> wraps it into an
<A HREF="../Reference/w3c.jigsaw.resources.HTTPResource.html">HTTPResource</A>
object (see <A HREF="../Introduction/indexer.html"><B>Jigsaw</B> resource
factory documentation</A> for more information on this). This resource factory
maintains a database to keep track of how files should be wrapped into resources.
This database, known as the <I>extensions</I> database describe, for each
extension, an (optional) mapping to some resource class, along with a set
of default attribute values for the newly created resource that will encapsulate
the file.
<P>
Let's say we want all files having the <CODE>png</CODE> extension, to be
exported by a
<A HREF="../Reference/w3c.jigsaw.resources.FileResource.html">FileResource</A>
instance (the FileResource class is the class that knows how to send back
files as reply to requests). We also want to state that the
<CODE>content-type</CODE> attribute value for these file resources should
be <B>image/x-png</B>. We first point our favorite browser to
<CODE>/Admin/Extensions</CODE>, this displays the sorted list of registered
extensions. What we want to do is to add a new extension, so we click on
the <I>Add extension</I> link. This brings up a new form, asking us for an
extension name, and an (optional) class. We fill in the name of the extension
(<CODE>png</CODE>, <I>without</I> the leading dot), and the extension class
(<CODE>w3c.jigsaw.resources.FileResource</CODE>), and then press the
<I>Create</I> button. This brings up yet another form, which allows us to
enter default attribute values for resources that will be created through
this extension. We want to specify the <CODE>content-type</CODE>, so we fill
this field with <B>image/x-png</B>, and - just for fun - we may want the
default icon for theses resources to be <B>image.gif</B>, so we fill in this
field too. We then press the <I>OK</I> button, which brings us back to the
list of extensions (in which the new <CODE>png</CODE> extension has been
inserted).
<P>
If you have a <CODE>.png</CODE> file under <B>Jigsaw</B> space directory,
you can now query it: the resource factory will know how to wrap into a
FileResource, and will send it back to you properly.
<P>
In some cases, you may just want to state that for all files having a particular
extensions, some specific attribute should default to some specific value.
A typicall example of this is to state that files having the <CODE>.fr</CODE>
extension have been written in french. To handle such a case, we just follow
the above procedure: we follow the <I>Add extension</I> link, and fill in
the name of the extension (<CODE>fr</CODE> here), however, this time, we
will leave the class name empty. This means that by itself, the
<CODE>fr</CODE> extension will not cause a file to be exported, but <I>if</I>
a file having the <CODE>fr</CODE> extension is to be exported (because, for
example, it has both the <CODE>fr</CODE> and <CODE>html</CODE> extensions),
then we are willing to provide some default values for some of its generic
attributes. We press the <I>Create</I> button to register the extension,
this brings up a form containing the generic attributes (i.e. attribute tha
apply to <I>all</I>
<A HREF="../Reference/w3c.jigsaw.resources.HTTPResource.html">HTTPResource</A>
instances). We just fill in the <CODE>content-language</CODE> field, stating
that its value should be <B>fr</B>, then we press the <I>OK</I> button, which
brings us back to the list of registered extensions (in which <CODE>fr</CODE>
has been inserted).
<P>
You should now be able to register as many extensions as you want. You should
also check that the default extensions meet your &nbsp;expectations, by carefully
viewing them. You may also want to remove some of the default extensions,
or the one we have created above. To delete an extension, go to the page
displaying the list of registered extensions, mark the ones you want to
unregister by clicking on the checkbox at their right, and press the
<I>Delete</I> button.
<P>
At this point, you might be surprised that we haven't <I>save</I> any of
our changes. <B>Jigsaw</B> uses a complex caching scheme, and it decides
itself when it is best to save changes to disk. However, you should remember
that because of this, the server should be killed <I>only</I> by getting
the <CODE>/Admin/Exit</CODE> resource (which will shutdown the server properly,
saving to disk what needs to be saved at this point). If you really want
your changes to be saved right now, you can still click on the /Admin/Properties
<I>checkpoint</I> link, which will ensure all cached data are written back
to the disk (it's usually a good idea to do that after editing the
configuration).
<H3>
  <A NAME="factory-templates">Directory templates</A>
</H3>
<P>
The <A HREF="#factory-extensions">previous section</A> has explained how
to map files to resources based on their extensions. This section now explains
how to map directories to resources.
<P>
As for files, mapping directories to resources is done by the
<A HREF="../Introduction/indexer.html">resource factory</A>, however the
mapping is done per directories name, rather then per extensions. <I>Directory
templates</I> are records that describe how directories of a given name should
be mapped to resource instances. The first rule to be aware of, is that if
no directory templates is available for a specific directory, the file-system
directory will be exported through a simple
<A HREF="../Reference/w3c.jigsaw.resources.DirectoryResource.html">DirectoryResource</A>
instance.
<P>
Back to directory templates. Directory templates associate a directory name
with a resource class along with a set of default attribute values for the
directory. Directory templates may be of two kinds: they can be
<I>generic</I> or <I>normal</I> (depending on the value of their
<CODE>generic</CODE> attribute). Generic directory templates apply to all
directories having, as part of their path, the directory template name, while
normal directory templates apply only to directory whose last name is the
template name. Generic directory templates allows you to use some specific
directory resource to export a whole hierarchy of information.
<P>
To access the directory templates database, point your favorite browser to
<CODE>/Admin/DirectoryTemplates</CODE>. This will list the currently defined
directory templates. Let's add a new directory template, for all
<CODE>CVS</CODE> directories, which we want to export through the
<A HREF="../Reference/w3c.jigsaw.cvs.CvsDirectoryResource.html">CvsDirectoryResource</A>
(this resource provides a form-based interface to CVS). To do this, we follow
the <I>Add directory</I> link, which brings up a form that prompts us for
a directory name and a directory class. We want this directory template to
apply to all <CODE>CVS </CODE>directory, so the name is just
<CODE>CVS</CODE>, and we want these directories to be exported through a
<CODE>w3c.jigsaw.cvs.CvsDirectoryResource</CODE> instance. We fill in the
fields, and press the <I>OK</I> button, this brings up a new form, with the
templates attribute themselves. We don't want this directory template to
be generic, so we leave these fields alone. The <I>template</I> link brings
up a form to edit the default attribute values for the resource to be created.
The fields in this form depends on the class you have given when you created
the directory template. In the case of the
<A HREF="../Reference/w3c.jigsaw.cvs.CvsDirectoryResource.html">CvsDirectoryResource</A>,
none of these attributes need default values, so we just skip them. We are
all set, now when the resource factory will be queried to wrap a directory
whose name is <CODE>CVS</CODE>, instead of creating a directory resource,
it will create a resource that will allow you to control the cvs status of
the files in the directory, neat isn't it ?
<P>
Another typical usage of directory templates, is to use them to provide writable
areas. The
<A HREF="../Reference/w3c.jigsaw.resources.PutableDirectory.html">PutableDirectory</A>
class extends the basic
<A HREF="../Reference/w3c.jigsaw.resources.PutableDirectory.html">DirectoryResource</A>
class with the ability to create new resources to handle the HTTP <I>PUT</I>
method (a bunch of browsers now support this PUT method, you can try for
example <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Amaya/">Amaya</A>, or
<A HREF="http://www.tools.gnn.com/">GNN</A>). Let's define a directory template
for some directory named <CODE>Writable</CODE> and all its children directories.
As before, we click on the <I>Add directory</I> link, the name of our directory
template is simply <CODE>Writable</CODE> and its associated class is
<CODE>w3c.jigsaw.resources.PutableDirectory</CODE>. We press the <I>OK</I>
button, and this time, we state that the template is generic, by setting
the generic attribute to <B>true</B>. This time we want to edit the
<I>template</I> so we follow the link. The first thing we may want to do
is to provide a fancy default icon, so that putable directories can be
distinguished from the others, lets' use <CODE>burst.gif</CODE>, then if
using GNN, you might want to turn the <CODE>browsable</CODE> attribute to
<B>true</B>. This will make the resource handles the GNN specific
<I>BROWSE</I> method. We press the <I>OK</I> button, and we are done. Don't
forget to read the authentication section, that will explain how to setup
<A HREF="#authentication">authentication</A> for these kinds of directories.
<P>
At some point, you may want to delete directory templates. In this case,
go to the <CODE>/Admin/DirectoryTemplates</CODE> location, and mark each
of the templates you want to delete by clicking on the checkbox to the right
of their names. Then press the <I>Delete</I> button, you are done.
<H2>
  <A NAME="editing">Editing</A>
</H2>
<P>
At this point, you should be able to run <B>Jigsaw</B>, to configure its
properties and to edit the resource factory configuration databases. In this
section, we will concentrate on <B>Jigsaw</B>'s ability to edit existing
resources.
<P>
In some circumstances, you may want to customize a single resource of your
whole information space. This may be because you want it to have a specific
icon, or because it's a special resource that needs some specific configuration,
etc.
<P>
Just for fun, let's say that although the document
<CODE>/User/Overview.html</CODE> has the <CODE>html</CODE> extension, we
want its content type to be advertized as text. To do this, what is needed
is to edit the <CODE>content-type </CODE>attribute of the appropriate resource
in order to change it into <B>text/plain<I>.</I></B> <B>Jigsaw</B> comes
with a generic resource editor (which is itself a resource), that allows
you to edit any specific resource exported by the server. To edit a resource,
we just append its path to the <CODE>/Admin/Editor</CODE> resource. So, to
edit our <CODE>/User/Overview.html</CODE> resource, we just point our browser
to <CODE>/Admin/Editor/User/Overview.html</CODE>. This brings up a form
containing the specific attributes of the resource. The one we are interested
in, here, is its <CODE>content-type</CODE> that we change to
<B>text/plain</B>. We press the <I>OK</I> button, et voila ! Try loading
<CODE>/User/Overview.html</CODE>: instead of displaying the HTML document
itself, your browser should now display the HTML text making the document.
Enough fun, let's turn the resource <CODE>content-type</CODE> to
<B>text/html</B>, and check that the resource is back to normal...good !
<P>
All resources are editable in the same way, again for fun only, let's say
we want to add the
<A HREF="../Reference/w3c.jigsaw.status.ThreadStat.html">ThreadStat</A> resource
(which display the threads running in the server) into the <CODE>/User</CODE>
directory resource. To do this, we launch the generic editor on the
<CODE>/User</CODE> directory, by pointing our browser to
<CODE>/Admin/Editor/User</CODE> location. This brings up a form with one
field per directory resource attribute. This time, what we want to do is
to add a resource, so we go straight down the page, and follow the <I>Add
resource</I> link. We are prompted for a resource name, and a resource class.
The name of the resource is the name under which it will be retreived from
its directory, let's use <CODE>threads</CODE>. The full class name of the
ThreadStat resource is <CODE>w3c.jigsaw.status.ThhreadStat</CODE>. We fill
in the two fields, and press the <I>Create</I> button. Then we follow the
<I>Existing resources</I> link. This shows up a sorted list of all the resources
contained by the <CODE>/User</CODE> directory resource, among which is the
<CODE>threads</CODE> resource. Follow <I>threads </I>link, this pops up an
editor to edit the ThreadStat resource attributes. You may want to change
the refresh rate, by changing the value of the <CODE>refresh</CODE> attribute
(which gives the refresh period in seconds). Press the <I>OK</I> button.
Now point your browser to <CODE>/User/threads</CODE>, and you will see the
threads that the server is running.
<P>
Now that we got all this fun, its time to do some clean-up, let's remove
the <CODE>threads</CODE> resource from the <CODE>/User</CODE> directory resource.
Point your browser to the <CODE>/Admin/Editor/User</CODE> location. Mark
the <CODE>threads</CODE> resource by clicking on the checkbox right to its
name, &nbsp;select the <CODE>Remove</CODE> command and press the <I>OK</I>
button. By the way, the <CODE>Reindex</CODE> button here, will reindex the
marked resources (this is usefull if you change your resource factory
configuration), and the <CODE>Update</CODE> button will update any of the
resource attributes that is computed.
<H2>
  <A NAME="authentication">Authentication</A><B></B>
</H2>
<P>
At this point, you nearly knows everything about <B>Jigsaw</B>. This section
will provide you wit ha basic explanation of filters, and how to use them
to setup authentication.
<P>
Resource filters are attached to specific resources in order to filter accesses
to them. These filters are called once at lookup time, and once at reply
time. On the way in (lookup time), they allow you to manipulate the request
before the target resource handles it, and on the way out, they allow you
to manipulate the target's reply before it is emited back to the browser.
<P>
Although <B>Jigsaw</B> provides a <A HREF="../Reference/filters.html">number
of filters</A>, we will focus here on the authentication filter, that
authenticate requests before thy are handled by their appropriate target
resources. The
<A HREF="../Reference/w3c.jigsaw.auth.GenericAuthFilter.html">GenericAuthFilter</A>
is currently the only available authentication filter.
<P>
To illustrate its usage, we will go through the steps required to protect
the <CODE>/Admin</CODE> directory. The first thing you want to do, is to
define an authentication <I>realm</I>. An authentication realm is a database
that will contain the description of a set of users, along with their passwords
and/or IP adresses. Let's first define an <CODE>admin</CODE> authentication
realm, describing all the users allowed to access the <CODE>/Admin</CODE>
resources.For this we point our favorite browser to
<CODE>/Admin/Realms</CODE>. This display the set of authentication realms
the server knows about (this will be empty at this time). Let's create our
realm: we click on the <I>Add realm</I> link, which brings up a form prompting
us for the realm name (the server wide identifier for the realm), and the
realm <I>repository</I>. Let's fill in the realm name with
<CODE>admin</CODE>. The realm repository is the name of the file that the
server will use to store the users database for the realm, it's good practice
to put these files under the <CODE>config/auth</CODE> directory of
<B>Jigsaw</B>. So we fill in the repository field with
<CODE>.../config/auth/admin.db</CODE> (were <CODE>...</CODE> is to be substituted
by the absolute path of the root directory of the server). Once both fields
are filled in, we press the <I>Create</I> button to create the realm. This
brings up a form containing the list of users defined in the realm (which
is, of course, initially empty). We follow the <I>AddUser</I> link, which
prompts us for a user name. Let's say that <CODE>admin</CODE> is the user
we want to describe. We fill in the name, and press the <I>Create</I> button,
this again brings up new form, prompting us for a bunch of information about
the <CODE>admin</CODE> user. The email address is currently unused (but it
might be used in the future for email notification), you can iethre fill
it of leave it empty. You can type in any comments in the comments field
which is used only for informational purposes. The ipaddress field allows
you to state from which machine the user is allowed to connect. This field
is not mandatory: if left blank, only the password will be used for
authentication (be warned that the password authentication scheme used by
HTTP is very weak, for protecting such a critic space as the
<CODE>Admin</CODE> space, you should always specify both a password and some
IP addresses). If you decide to fill in the ipaddress field, you can enter
multiple addresses for the same user (one per line). In my case, I fill it
with my office IP address and my home IP address, so I enter the following
two lines of text:
<PRE>18.52.0.144
18.23.1.195
</PRE>
<P>
You can also use <I>*</I> in the ip address field, meaning that any user
connecting from the given set of IP addresses is to be authentified as the
<CODE>admin</CODE> user. We then enter some password, and any optional groups
we want the user to belong to (groups are a way of tagging a set of users
belonging to the same realm, we will see some sample usage of groups below).
<P>
Once all the fields are filled-in, we press the <I>OK</I> button: the
<CODE>admin</CODE> user is now registered as part of the <CODE>admin</CODE>
realm. You can define as much users as you want, by following these same
instructions.
<P>
Once you are satisfied with your realm, it is time to actually protect the
<CODE>/Admin</CODE> directory. For this purpose we launch the generic resource
editor on the <CODE>/Admin</CODE> resource by pointing our browser to
<CODE>/Admin/Editor/Admin</CODE> location. What we want to do is add the
authentication filter as one of the filters for the <CODE>/Admin</CODE> resource:
we click on the <I>Add filter</I> link, and enter the following filter class:
<CODE>w3c.jigsaw.auth.GenericAuthFilter</CODE>. We press the <I>OK</I> button
to register the filter, this add two new links to the editor: let's follow
the <I>filter-0</I> link. This pops up a form-based editor to edit the filter's
attributes. The first identifier field need not be filled in (you can change
it to <I>auth</I> in order to have more relevants link names), you can just
skip it. The method field allow you to describe what methods are to be protected.
As the <CODE>/Admin</CODE> is such a critic resource, we want to protect
it against any method, which is the default when the field is left blank
(otherwise, we would specify one method per line). The realm name field must
be filled in: it should give the identifier of the realm we want to use for
authenticating the <CODE>/Admin</CODE> space. We use here the realm that
we have created above: <CODE>admin</CODE>. The users field allows you to
restrict access further to only a set of users in the realm, and the group
field allows you to restrict access to a set of groups of the realm. In both
cases you should enter one user name (or group name) per line. If left blank,
all users within the realm will be allowed in (which is what we want since
we have defined a specific realm to describe the users that are allowed to
configure the server). We can now press on the <I>OK</I> button: the
<CODE>/Admin</CODE> directory is now protected. To check this, just point
your browser to <CODE>/Admin</CODE>, this should now prompt you for a user
name, and a password.
<P>
You are now all set: <B>Jigsaw</B> is configured, enjoy !
